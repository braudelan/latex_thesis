1. fallow and low plant activity reduces biological activity, SOM, Aggregate stability
2. high variability in biological soil features.
3. WOEC correlated with TOC and in equilibrium with solid phase SOM
4. land use changes cause changes in microbial community composition ( e.g. fungi-to-bacteria).
5. cattle slurry reduces F:B ratio
6. birch effect 
	- increases in microbial activity and WEOC
	- decreases in AS.
	- effect observable also after sharp increase in water content from already wet conditions
