      "\t\t\tthe mean mbc across all sampling events was \\~{}400 mg/kg in both ltts. This value is relatively high compared with some of the results from arable soils \\citep{jat2020, haynes1999,garcia-orenes2010}, yet it is important to consider that extensive variation is reported for mbc depending on various edaphic and climatic features as well as temporal variability\\myred{*}. A comparison of the initial mbc value from our preliminary and main incubations demonstrate this kind of variability. Initial mbc in the non-amended samples from the main incubation stood at \\~{}200 \\genericunit while the level of mbc in these corresponding samples from the preliminary incubation did not decrease below 350 \\genericunit. This distinction was probably related to the effect of rapid increases in humidity level (wetting of soil samples) on the microbial population and the different time frames captured by these two experiments, due to differing pre-incubation periods (detailed discussion follows shortly). Interestingly, control samples did not show a sharp pulse of microbial growth in the first 24 h of incubation, as was observed in the main incubation. In min samples only a small insignificant increase was observed during the first 24h while for org, a significant and considerable increase in mbc was observed after 48h, yet this was  not nearly as large as the increase observed in the main experiment. This contrast between the controls of the main and preliminary incubation was similarly observed for resp and weoc. Respiration in the preliminary incubation resp rates were higher than main incubation respiration during the first 24 h, thereafter presenting comparable values. Initial weoc levels in the preliminary incubation were \\~{}4 times higher than initial values in the main incubation control samples. \\myred{as briefly noted earlier}, this discrepancy may have been related to the different duration of pre-incubation in these two experiments ( 48 h vs. 120 h in the preliminary and main incubation respectively). It is suggested that the shorter pre-incubation in the preliminary experiment resulted in a different snapshot of the dynamics being captured by our sampling in these two experiments. Presumably the 5 day pre-incubation in the main incubation had initially caused an increase in microbial activity and weoc which had - by day 5 when the actual incubation was initiated ($ t_0 $)-been mostly diminished. This pulse dynamics following a rapid increase in water content was repeatedly observed, to varying degrees, in the preliminary and main incubation following water additions and is furthermore commonly reported in literature (see discussion and relevant references in section \\hyperref[subsection_4.2.2]{section 4.2.2}). This presumed decline in microbial activity and weoc can explain the relatively low levels of these soil features at $ t_0 $ in the main incubation . Contrarily, it is most likely that a similar pulse of microbial activity and weoc in the pre-incubation of the preliminary experiment, had not already seen a such a considerable decline after only 48 h. Thus, the higher levels of microbial biomass and activity as well as weoc at $ t_0 $ in controls samples in the preliminary incubation, supposedly express the different time frame being observed. The intense pulse of microbial growth observed in the main incubation (but not in the preliminary incubation) during the first 24 h supports the above explanation.\\\\\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t\tthe total cumulative respiration, standing at 127 and 154 mg/kg after 168 h of incubation seem to be on the higher end of the literature reported range of cumulative respiration after one week of incubation without amendment\\citep{ribeiro2010}.\\\\ \t\n",
      "\n",
      "\t \t\tthe higher levels of weoc in org compared with min, observed throughout the incubation, probably reflect higher soc stocks in org, as weoc levels are often closely related to som stocks\\citep{malik2013} . Weoc dynamics seem to inversely correspond with both resp dynamics and mbc dynamics. This is clearly manifested in org samples, where a substantial mbc pulse between 24 and 96 h is concurrently accompanied by a decrease-increase pattern of very similar proportions in weoc.\\\\\n",
      "\n",
      "\t \t\tthere seems to be a certain delay before weoc responded to changes in resp rate, as peak resp is observed in the first 24 h while weoc begins to decline just after that time period. Nonetheless there is a considerable concurrence between these two parameters, as weoc declines rapidly during a the 24 to 48 h period when resp are still relatively high and inversely increases between 48 and 96h, when resp rates had mostly reached their lowest level, showing little change in that time period. These concurrent dynamics may reflect the often noted interrelation between these three soil parameters. Mbc and resp are clearly closely related, yet it is also a common view that weoc represents a labile dom pool that serves as an easily available energy source for micro-organisms and is thus closely associated with the dynamics of microbial growth and activity (i.E mbc and resp)\\citep{kemmitt2008, kaisermichael2012, guggenberger1998}. Results from this preliminary incubation, are in accordance with this line of evidence.\\\\\n",

Similar observations were made by \\citet{haynes2005} and \\citet{ghani2000, ghani2003} though both reported higher proportions of sugar-c in hwec. It is likely that this higher ratio is related to higher om content and the presence of annual grasses in the soils referred to in these works, as this type of land cover has been associated with higher sugar-c content in hw extracts \\citep{haynes1993}.\n",

This may reflect the sizes of these hwe carbon pools in the current experiment, which were \\~{}3 to \\~{}10 times larger than weoc in control samples (for hwec and hwes-c respectively). Additionally, the hwec pool is less susceptible tp microbial degradation than weoc and  considered more stable. Thus, given any control of microbial action on the dynamics of hwec (or hwes), it would probably have been less significant then for weoc and these possible effects would have been far less noticeable due to the large proportion of hwe fractions in comparison with the size of microbial biomass, and the extent of its activity (e.G respiration rate). Indeed, the total cumulative respiration  in either org or min was less than 200 mg/kg co2-c and the largest increase in mbc, recorded in org samples between 24-48 h, was \\~{}150 mg/kg. These possible sinks would account for no more than 25 and 40\\% of the initial hwec in org and min respectively. \\\\\n",

      "\t\t\tdespite our expectations, both cultivated ltts and especially org had resulted in higher baseline values for most parameters, compared with the non-cultivated ltt. Although agricultural intensification and long term fertilization has been repeatedly shown to diminish overall soil health and cause a reduction in som, compared with non-cultivated soils \\citep{laurance2014, mganga2016, tilman2011}, there is some evidence pointing out that this is not necessarily the case for certain agricultural management scenarios, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments.  For example, \\citet{trivedi2016}, in a meta analysis, found that in arid climates, cultivated soils had on average significantly higher values of soc compared with unmanaged soils. Similarly, repeated analysis of a large data base from soils in the us great plains area, revealed that soc loss due to cultivation was lowest in low rainfall areas ($ \\sim $300 mm map)\\citep{miller2004, burke1989}. \\citet{paz-kagan2014} conducted a research that included soils from the migda research farm (\\~{}30 km from the gilat research center, with similar climatic conditions and soil properties), and found no significant improvement in soil quality index(sqi) (including soil parameters such as som, hydraulic conductivity and surface hardness) when transitioning between agricultural land use and a natural ecosystem management. \\citet{garcia-orenes2010} found no significant decrease in soil health parameters (toc, weoc, mbc, basal respiration) compared with an adjacent abandoned field (some natural vegetation cover) in soils from sw portugal, treated for one year by  a number of different agricultural practices, including tillage and herbicide use. Although these different treatments were each tested separately (e.G compare tilled soil to non-cultivated soil),as opposed to combined long-term treatments in the current work (e.G. Compare conventional management to unmanaged soil ), and lasted for only one year, nonetheless, the outcome of this work, clearly support the notion that certain agricultural practices may not have a detrimental effect on overall soil health when compared with non-cultivated soils in a semi-arid climate context. Indeed some practices - in the case garcía-orenes’s work, the return of substantial amount of oat straw – can actually cause a significant improvement in soil health parameters, not just compared with a non-cultivated soil but also compared with a natural cover soil ( mediterranean woodland ).\\\\\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t\tour results provide additional evidence supporting a similar line of evidence. Five years of intense compost application ( $ 6 m^3*year^{-1} $ ) combined with an otherwise conventional management system (org ltt), increased toc by almost 60\\% over an adjacent uncultivated soil (unc). Org had also resulted in increased baseline levels of soc fractions such as mbc, weoc  and hwes-c  as well as higher basal resp and higher as, compared with unc. \\\\\n",

      "\t\t\tnet primary productivity (npp) is the net solar energy accumulated by vegetation per unit area and unit time.

Concurrently these trends where in accordance with soc trends in soils from these two types of ecosystems, indicating the connection between the build up of som  and ecosystem productivty. \\citet{bhardwaj2011} presented direct evidence relating the improvement in soil quality indices to increased npp, when examining a set of long-term intensively managed row crop systems in the upper midwest part of the usa.\n",

As mentioned before, a zero fertilization period of two years, of which one year was fallow (\\myred{‘no input + fallow period’}), preceded soil sampling. The discontinuation of fertilization inputs practically eliminated management differences between org and min in that period, and the fallow period is likely to have caused significant reductions in biological activity and aggregate structure\\myred{*}.

Although the current experiment did not include a typical drying-wetting cycle as common in  studies on the subject, including those cited above, our soil samples did experience a period of air dry conditions (3-4 months in the field  and then another 1-3 months in air tight bags at 4c) followed by wetting to moderate water content for 5 days(50\\% whc during pre-incubation) and then another wetting event at the onset of the incubation. It is therefore suggested that the observed changes following the second wetting event, i.E at $ t_0$, begining of incubation, were of similar essence as those described in the above mentioned studies, as this type of soil response has also been observed following a rapid increase in water content even when the soil was already in wet conditions\\citep{xiang2008, rey2005}. \n",

These processes involve the physical action of water addition and the biological action of micro-organisms, both acting simultaneously as a possible enhancing agent as well as a possible sink for dom. It is possible that the rapid increase in weoc observed during the first 24 h, was the result of water addition causing desorption and redistribution of available om, thus increasing weoc levels. These increasing weoc levels may have been used by micro-organisms to fuel the observed growth burst during the first 24 hours, possibly causing further enhancement of dom replenishment.

Contrarily, in the two other ltts, where initial soc stocks were considerably lower, it is suggested that microbial activity had exhausted most of the easily available weoc, possibly inducing the microbial population to direct their efforts for energy extraction to other carbon sources such as those involved in stabilizing soil aggregates. This could explain the more drastic reduction in as observed in unc and min and furthermore supports the notion that maintained aggregate stability requires some degree of continues inflow of easily available organic matter \\citep{golchin1994 }. \\citet{cook1992} had observed a decreased microbial utilization of doc after two weeks of incubation despite high contents of doc suggesting the preferential accumulation of recalcitrant doc.\\\\\n",

Since total hwe carbon data is not available for this incubation, it remains unknown whether the degradation of other hwe components may have been related to as decline and whether this degradation was indeed initiated by  the exhaustion of easily available carbon fraction such as weoc.\\\\\n",

      "\t\tthe above explanation (‘dom first’ rational) implies  the reduction in microbial activity is largely driven by decreased substrate availability, as easily degradable dom supply was supposedly significantly reduced during the first week of incubation. The relatively concurrent variations in weoc and co2-resp seems to be in agreement with this kind of description, particularly for unc and min ltts, in which co2-resp dynamics between days 7-10 (excluding the first few hours after the 2nd and 3rd water additions) appear to follow the dynamics of weoc, albeit with a delay of 24 hour. Some  degree of discordance with this reasoning is expressed in mbc dynamics, as the decrease in its concentration preceded that of weoc and  co2-resp by several days, which might suggest an alternative explanation for their subsequent decline, namely that a considerable reduction in microbial activity and the consequent decrease in som solubilization, was the primary driver for the observed decline in weoc ( ‘microbial activity first’ rational) as opposed to dom levels dictating the degree of microbial activity as suggested in the \\textit{dom first} rationalization.\\\\\n",

It is therefore suggested that although mbc levels started to decline several days before any decrease in weoc was observed, this does not necessarily imply a causational relationship. Considering the high level of co2 production rates during the first week of incubation, even when mbc had declined significantly, it is suggested that an active fraction of the tmb had kept microbial activity levels, particularly with regard to som decomposition, at relatively constant intensity, despite the large die off in the overall population. \\\\\n",

Their results showed a clear negative correlation between these two parameters, meaning that higher clay content and surface area allowed for higher fraction of applied glucose to remain in the soil. Sagger et al. Additionally found the mean residence time of microbially assimilated glucose-c to be significantly and positively correlated with clay content and surface area. These results taken together, led them to conclude that ‘clay and surface area played a major role in controlling the decomposition of added substrate through the stabilization and protection of the microbial biomass’\\citep[p. 12]{saggar1999}. The recent works of \\citet{kravchenko2019, kravchenko2015} provided strong evidence for the importance of spatial configuration of soil surface area in the $ \\mu m $ level for determining the fate of organic matter decomposition products. They had shown that the proximity of microbial sites of increased activity to soil pores and surfaces that can provide optimal conditions for the physical and/or chemical protection of organic molecules, can have a critical effect on the fate of microbial decomposition products. \n",

Otherwise, if for instance the number of microbial cells is much higher than the number of carbon traps, $ \\%stabilization  $ is likely to be low, as a greater proportion of microbial cells are likely to be situated further away from a carbon trap and the likelihood of other adjacent microbial cells ingesting and respiring decomposition products would increase (scenario \\# 2). A high proportion of substrate molecules to microbial cells (high substrate-to-biomass ratio),  is similarly assumed to result in low stabilization efficiency, as it would lead to a surge  of microbial growth eventually culminating in a similar situation described in scenario \\# 2. A third scenario would entail a high number of carbon traps relative to the number of microbial cells and the number of substrate molecules and this scenario is assumed to result in higher $ \\%stabilization $.  In conclusion, this simplified model suggests that any given situation in which either substrate or microbial biomass are considerably high in proportion to the spatial soil availability for interaction and protection of incoming om decomposition products, will result in lower stabilization efficiency. Evidently, various important factors that could significantly affect the fate of organic inputs in the soil, such as microbial community composition, mineralogical features (clay type etc.), have not been considered in the model. More importantly, the solid phase in the model is assumed to act as a sink exclusively. The model is therefore most suitable for situations where assumption \\ref{item: negligible_priming}, i.E negligible priming is applicable (e.G. High rate labile carbon input).

This approach has proven to be at least partially successful in illustrating the effect of sequential labile substrate applications, as it indicated a reduction in sue with subsequent mre additions. A much more limited success was achieved in trying to distinguish the effect of management history on the short term dynamics of som properties, using  the cue index. As noted earlier, org and min displayed a very similar  reduction in cue throughout the incubation, while a somewhat erratic pattern was observed for unc. Additionally, large uncertainties are associated with the weekly cue results making it hard to assert  meaningful distinction between ltts.\\\\\n",

Weoc levels had peaked at almost 1000 mg/kg  24 h after the first mre addition in unc samples and the corresponding peak 24 h after the third mre application in these unc samples was almost double the size of the first peak. Data is missing for the second peak in unc samples, yet it is assumed to have followed the trend suggested by the large differences between the first and third weoc peak. This trend is similarly observed in min samples, albeit with a significantly lower intensity. Remarkably, these sharp increases in weoc 24 h after mre addition, were not observed in org on any sampling event.\\\\\n",

      " \t\tthe intensity of weoc pulses after each mre addition increased both in time ( with consecutive mre applications) and also between ltts, in the following order, unc $ > $ min $ > $ org. This order of response intensity between the three ltts, most clearly notable 1 day after mre additions, seems to be largely opposite to the order of baseline soc content and baseline mbc between these ltts, which were as follows, org $ > $ min $ > $ unc (differences in mbc between org and min and between min and unc in soc, are not significant). This suggest  that higher initial som content and/or higher extant microbial biomass may have been related to moderated fluctuations in weoc following mre additions and to moderated increases in the intensity of these fluctuations as the incubation preceded \\mygreen{(as more labile substrate was introduced)}. Additionally, cumulative respiration in the three ltts suggests the connection between elevated microbial activity (i.E respiration) and the quick removal of labile organic carbon.\\\\\n",
      "\n",
      "\t \tin the current experiment, an exceptionally high load of labile organics was applied with each mre addition, roughly an order of magnitude higher than baseline mbc values.  Although labile dom is usually rapidly consumed by the soil microbial population\\myred{*} it is possible that in situations were a proportionally large amount of labile substrate is rapidly introduced, the microbial population would be unable to process it completely\\myred{*} in the very short term of several hours to a day or two, and thus considerable amounts of substrate could be accumulated as weom. This seems to have been the case in the current experiment, where in the first week of incubation both org and min, presumably possessing a significantly higher reserve of active and potentially active microbial biomass, presented a very low increase in weoc 24 h after mre addition . This is suggestive of the metabolic capacity of these soil microbial populations allowing them to rapidly consume and break down the input substrate to the extent that it is unrecoverable as weom, either by mineralization of the substrate into co2, its immobilization as mb or its transformation into metabolic products that would have somehow been bound to the solid soil phase, rendering it unextractable with water. In the subsequent mre additions, it is assumed that, even though mre input load was unchanged, the conditions with regard to microbial biomass and overall labile om availability had been altered significantly, resulting in the increased intensity of weoc pulses in these subsequent mre additions (in min and unc). As discussed earlier, it is suggested that by the end of the first week of incubation, the levels of labile om availability had increased substantially (leftover carbon). While mbc also increased  considerably in all three ltts during the first week, it is proposed that the substrate-to-biomass  ratio had increased considerably between the first and second mre additions in min and unc, which may have been the primary reason for the observed pulses of weoc following mre addition, as the microbial populations in these soil samples were ineffective in removing the large influx of dom during the first 24 h. \n",
