Soil sampling

\begin_layout Standard
The soils for this experiment were sampled from the long term plots installed at Gilat in 2009 as part of the organic agriculture project (Gilat Organic Plots), Bar-Tal et al (2017). The Gilat Research center is situated in the northern Negev (31°20' N, 34°41' E), the climate is a semi-desert (average precipitation 237 mm) and the soil is a sandy loam loess, defined as a calcic Xerosol (Soil Survey Staff, 2010). The experimental platform included 4 treatments in 4 random blocks in five replicates (20 sub-plots on an area of ca. 1 hectar). these four treatments were as follows: three levels of cow manure compost application at the rates of 2, 4 and 6

 (equivalent to 1, 1.9 and 3.8 
\begin_inset Formula $kg^3\cdot dunam^{-1}\cdot year^{-1}$
\end_inset

 respectively) and a control treatment (urea fertilizer). For the current experiment the 6

 compost treatment, i.e organic (ORG) and the urea treatment, i.e mineral (MIN), were used. Additionally soil samples were taken from a non-cultivated (NOC) area outside the experimental grounds (unmanaged for at least 6 years, since the Gilat Organic Plots were set up). Average properties of the compost applied are given in table #. the annual crop rotation program, compost application schedule and all other elements were according to typical organic agriculture management standards in the area. The last fertilizer application was preformed on the June 2015 and January 2016 for the ORG and MIN treatments respectively. The last harvest took place on 14/11/16 and from that time on the soil was laid bare. Soil sampling was done in October 2017 before the first rain. 5 soil samples (for each replicate) were sampled from each treatment, sieved (

 2mm) and combined together to yield three compound samples representing the three long term treatments (LTTs), two cultivated, opposingly fertilized treatments, ORG and MIN and a non-cultivated treatment, NOC.
