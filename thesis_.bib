A long-term (13-14-year) field experiment was used to evaluate the effects of these management strategies on soil structural formation, structural stabilization and soil tilth of a sandy loam soil in Denmark. OM was applied as manure and by retention of plant residues (ORG) to be compared with plots dressed only with mineral fertilizer (MIN). The soils were rotovated (ROT), compacted (PAC) or left undisturbed (REF) as split-plot treatments in the main plots with OM management over two years prior to sampling. In two consecutive years, undisturbed soil samples were collected from the 6 to 13. cm soil layer in the field grown with winter wheat to assess soil organic carbon (C) fractions (total organic C, polysaccharide C and microbial biomass C), total organic C and polysaccharide C of 1-2. mm macro-aggregates, bulk density, hyphal length, aggregate stability, clay dispersibility, aggregate tensile strength, direct tensile strength and shear strength. The ease of fragmentation and the torsional shear strength of soil were measured in the field as well. OM application increased all soil organic C fractions. Response patterns of organic C fractions in aggregates were the same patterns as for whole-soil. Polysaccharide C appeared to be an important agent in the aggregation process. The effect of microbial C and fungal hyphae on the aggregation process was not clear. Extensive tillage and traffic produced unfavourable tilth conditions in terms of a greater degree of clay dispersion, lower aggregate stability, higher soil tensile strength and poorer soil fragmentation. OM affected soil reaction to compressive and tensile stresses applied at differing initial bulk densities. The results also indicated the profitability of supplementing the classical laboratory analysis with in situ measurements to better evaluate management effects on soil structure. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The relative importance of different binding mechanisms and associated biological binding agents on aggregate stability is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of various aggregate binding agents during the decomposition of cauliflower residues, wheat straw, cattle manure and poultry woody compost. We measured aggregate stability, hot-water extractable polysaccharide, C mineralization, fungal and microbial biomass dynamics in an amended silt loam soil, under controlled conditions. Soil aggregate stability was measured using three methods involving fast wetting, slow wetting and mechanical breakdown. Aggregate stability to slow wetting followed the same dynamics as C mineralization and was well correlated with polysaccharide content for cauliflower residues and wheat straw. This relationship is in agreement with the hypothesis that the rapid microbially induced improvement in aggregate stability that follows fresh organic residue additions at least partly involves labile polysaccharides. The transient increase in the two other types of stability was not directly related to C mineralization dynamics and seemed to be influenced by fungal hyphal length. Fungi would provide resistance to mechanical breakdown and slaking. The dynamic behaviour of biological binding agents was only partly explained by the initial quality of the organic materials, as characterized by Van Soest proximal fractionation. L'importance relative des diff\'erents m\'ecanismes d'agr\'egation et des facteurs agr\'egeants biologiques associ\'es n'est toujours pas clairement \'etablie. L'objectif de cette \'etude est d'\'evaluer l'effet de diff\'erents facteurs agr\'egeants sur la stabilit\'e structurale au cours de la d\'ecomposition de produits organiques: de r\'esidus de chou-fleur, de paille de bl\'e, d'un fumier de bovin et d'un compost de fientes de volailles et d'\'ecorce de peuplier. Nous avons mesur\'e les dynamiques de stabilit\'e des agr\'egats, de min\'eralisation du C et des biomasses microbienne et fongique d'un sol limoneux amend\'e pour des conditions contr\^ol\'ees. La stabilit\'e structurale est mesur\'ee par trois traitements d'intensit\'es diff\'erentes correspondant \`a une humectation rapide, une humectation lente et une d\'esagr\'egation m\'ecanique sur des agr\'egats.

  abstract = {Since the beginning of the last century, many studies have reported evidence describing the effects of organic inputs on soil aggregate stability. In 1965, Monnier proposed a conceptual model that considers different patterns of temporal effects on aggregate stability depending on the nature of the organic inputs: easily decomposable products have an intense and transient effect on aggregate stability while more recalcitrant products have a lower but longer term effect. We confronted this conceptual model with a literature review of experimental data from laboratory and field experiments. This literature analysis validated the conceptual model proposed by Monnier and pointed out gaps in our current knowledge concerning the relationships between aggregate stability and organic inputs. Noticeably, the experimental dataset confirmed the biological and temporal effects of organic inputs on aggregate stability as proposed in the model. Monnier's model also related the evolution of aggregate stability to different microbial decomposing agents, but this relationship was not made clear in this literature analysis. No direct or universal relationship was found between the aggregative factors induced by organic input decomposition (binding molecules or decomposers of biomass) and temporal aggregate stability dynamics. This suggests the existence of even more complex relationships. The model can be improved by considering (i) the direct abiotic effect of some organic products immediately after the inputs, (ii) the initial biochemical characteristics of the organic products and (iii) the effects of organic products on the various mechanisms of aggregate breakdown. For now, no trend is evident in the effect of the rate of organic inputs or the effect of the soil characteristics (essentially carbon and clay contents) on aggregate stability. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The influence of inorganic or organic fertilization on soil microbial ecology has been emphasized recently, but less is known about rhizosphere effects on extracellular enzyme activities and microbial community structure. Eleven extracellular enzymes involved in C, N, P, and S cycling and microbial community structure in both the rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from a long-term (31-year) fertilizer experimental field at the wheat reproductive stage were investigated by microplate fluorometric assay and phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), respectively. The samples were taken from six treatments: control (CK, without fertilization), fertilizer N (N), fertilizer N and P (NP), fertilizer N, P and K (NPK), organic manure (M), and organic manure plus fertilizer N, P and K (MNPK). Responses to inorganic or organic fertilizers in the rhizosphere were significantly different from those in the bulk soil. Except for NO3--N, thus, nutrient concentrations were generally higher in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. M and MNPK treatments greatly increased organic C, total N, NH4+-N and total S. Inorganic fertilizers (N, NP, and NPK) generally maintained or reduced most enzyme activities in the rhizosphere, but markedly increased these enzyme activities in the bulk soil. However, organic treatments (M and MNPK) enhanced most enzyme activities in both the rhizosphere and bulk soil. Higher total PLFA and lower ratios of bacteria to fungi and of actinomycetes to fungi were observed in the rhizosphere compared with the bulk soil. In the bulk soil, the ratios of bacteria to fungi and of actinomycetes to fungi were highest in the N treatment and lowest in the M treatment. However, in the rhizosphere there were no statistically significant differences in the abundance of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes between the inorganic and organic treatments. Organic fertilization increased total PLFA and Gram+ to Gram- bacteria ratio in both the rhizosphere and bulk soil. Our results indicated that changes in fertilization regime had a greater impact on the bulk soil microbial community than in the rhizosphere.},

How earthworm interacts with different organic residues, and how these interactions vary with time is still unclear. Earthworm processing of residues may modify their effectiveness as stabilising agents through changes in residue composition and disposition with regard to mineral particles. A mesocosm (2L) experiment was conducted to assess how Lumbricus terrestris L. and residues (grass-clover hay or wheat straw at 20gkg-1) affected aggregate stability (measured by wet sieving) over 40, 80 and 100 days; several microbial and organic carbon indices likely to affect aggregation were also measured to indicate temporal changes in stabilisation mechanisms. FT-IR analyses investigated relationships between kaolinite and specific organic fractions to indicate the degree of residue-mineral mixing in aggregates. In the absence of earthworms, straw was more effective than hay in promoting stability (+21\% vs +13\%), especially later in the incubations. Hay increased microbial biomass-C (MBC +73 vs +58mgkg-1) and K2SO4 extractable-C (KSE-C +44 vs -9mgkg-1) more than straw, but the converse was true for hyphal length (+6 vs +7.9mg-1). Earthworms reduced or eliminated these differences. Earthworms increased aggregation at 40 days (+17\%), although aggregation at 100 days was not affected. Earthworms changed the organic composition of aggregates (e.g. a relative decrease in polysaccharides) and may have promoted adsorption of otherwise labile fractions onto clays. Soon after residue inputs, aggregation was more closely associated with MBC and KSE-C, whereas with time aggregation became more closely related to hyphal length. The extent and persistence of benefits associated with organic inputs of differing quality will be influenced by earthworms, with earthworm mediated incorporation of residues into aggregates particularly important for the effectiveness of readily decomposable residues. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

A better knowledge of the vertical distribution of SOC and its controlling factors\textemdash the aim of this study\textemdash will help scientists predict the consequences of global change.Materials and methodsThe study area was the Murcia Province (S.E. Spain) under semiarid Mediterranean conditions. The database used consists of 312 soil profiles collected in a systematic grid, each 12 km2 covering a total area of 11,004 km2. Statistical analysis to study the relationships between SOC concentration and control factors in different soil use scenarios was conducted at fixed depths of 0\textendash 20, 20\textendash 40, 40\textendash 60, and 60\textendash 100 cm.Results and discussionSOC concentration in the top 40 cm ranged between 6.1 and 31.5 g kg-1, with significant differences according to land use, soil type and lithology, while below this depth, no differences were observed (SOC concentration 2.1\textendash 6.8 g kg-1). The ANOVA showed that land use was the most important factor controlling SOC concentration in the 0\textendash 40 cm depth. Significant differences were found in the relative importance of environmental and textural factors according to land use and soil depth. In forestland, mean annual precipitation and texture were the main predictors of SOC, while in cropland and shrubland, the main predictors were mean annual temperature and lithology. Total SOC stored in the top 1 m in the region was about 79 Tg with a low mean density of 7.18 kg Cm-3. The vertical distribution of SOC was shallower in forestland and deeper in cropland. A reduction in rainfall would lead to SOC decrease in forestland and shrubland, and an increase of mean annual temperature would adversely affect SOC in croplands and shrubland. With increasing depth, the relative importance of climatic factors decreases and texture becomes more important in controlling SOC in all land uses.ConclusionsDue to climate change, impacts will be much greater in surface SOC, the strategies for C sequestration should be focused on subsoil sequestration, which was hindered in forestland due to bedrock limitations to soil depth. In these conditions, sequestration in cropland through appropriate management practices is recommended.},

This method depends on the inherent UV absorption potential of hydrolysis byproducts of carbohydrates formed by reaction with concentrated sulfuric acid (furfural derivatives). The proposed method is a major improvement over the widely used Phenol-Sulfuric Acid method developed by DuBois, Gilles, Hamilton, Rebers, and Smith (1956). In the old method, furfural is allowed to develop color by reaction with phenol and its concentration is detected by visible light absorption. Here we present a method that eliminates the coloration step and avoids the health and environmental hazards associated with phenol use. In addition, avoidance of this step was shown to improve measurement accuracy while significantly reducing waiting time prior to light absorption reading. The carbohydrates for which concentrations and carbon content can be reliably estimated with this new rapid Sulfuric Acid-UV technique include: monosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides with very high molecular weight. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The application of both sludges at mid and high rates gave rise to significant increases of organic matter, humified substances and humic acids, but no effects on carbohydrates, microbial gums and aggregate stability were observed. As for biological activity in soils, the high variability of data led to a general absence of statistical significance despite the large differences between treatments observed. Significant increases of phosphodiesterase activity were nevertheless produced by the high rate of aerobic sludge and the mid and high rates of the anaerobic sludge.},

In this study we investigated the individual and combined effect of tillage system (no-tillage, NT; reduced tillage, RT; conventional tillage, CT) and cropping system (barley-fallow rotation at the Pe\~naflor site, PN-BF and continuous barley at the Pe\~naflor site, PN-BB) on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage as well as the physical protection of SOM fractions by soil aggregates in three long-term experimental sites. In both cropping systems, total SOC content was more than 30\% higher in NT compared with CT in the 0- to 5-cm depth. The suppression of fallowing in the PN-BB cropping system led to a greater SOC stabilization only in NT. In all the three sites, greater proportion of water-stable macroaggregates ({$>$}250 {$\mu$}m) was found under NT than under CT in the 0- to 5-cm depth. Macroaggregate organic C concentration (250-2000 {$\mu$}m) was greater in NT compared with CT in the BB cropping system, but did not differ with tillage treatment in the PN-BF rotation. Greater proportion of microaggregates within macroaggregates in NT compared with CT was only found in the Agramunt site (AG). However, greater C stabilized inside these microaggregates was observed in AG, Selvanera site (SV), and PN-BB in the 0- to 5-cm depth. The results of this study demonstrate that in the semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystems of the Ebro valley, the adoption of NT together with the suppression of long-fallowing period can significantly increase the amount of SOC stabilized in the soil surface and improve soil structure and aggregation. \textcopyright{} Soil Science Society of America.},

The method, which is based on the initial respiratory response of microbial populations to amendment with an excess of a carbon and energy source, was quantified using an expanded version of Jenkinson's technique. The simultaneous application of the two methods to 50 soil samples showed a highly significant correlation (r = 0.96) between both. From this correlation it could be deduced that at 22\textdegree C, a substrate-induced maximal respiratory rate of 1 ml CO2{$\cdot$} h-1corresponds to c. 40 mg microbial biomass C. Evidence supporting these results was obtained from pure culture studies. The various soil types investigated were collected from agricultural as well as forest sites and they contained between 15 and 240 mg microbial C{$\cdot$}100g dry soil-1. The respiratory method provides reproducible estimates of biomass size within 1-3 h after soil amendment. It can be combined without difficulty with a selective inhibition method for determination of bacterial and fungal contributions to soil metabolism. \textcopyright{} 1978.},

  abstract = {The metabolic quotient for CO* (qC0,) or specific respir-ation rate (Pirt, 1975) has been applied to soil microbial biomass analyses in maintenance energy investigations (Anderson and Domsch, 1985a, 1985b), in studies on the effect of temperature (Anderson and Domsch, 1986; Anderson and Gray, 1991; Joergensen et al., 1990), in comparisons of field managements (Anderson and Domsch, 1990), soil variables (Sandtruckova and Straskraba, 1991) in ecosystem successions (Insam and Haselwandter, 1989) and in studies on heavy metal stresses (FlieObach, unpubl. doctoral thesis, University of Giittingen, 1991). In this latter context similar quotients have been used by Brookes and McGrath (1984) and Killham (1985). The usefulness of such quotients for elucidating effects of environmental changes on microbial communities has been demonstrated by Anderson and Gray (1991). This approach was used in a study on the microbial biomass of different forest eco-systems in order to study and quantify the metabolic status of such soils: the use of eco-physiological constants allowed a direct comparison of true microbial activities of differ-ent soils. The aim was to test the ecosystem-level hypoth-esis of " Bioenergetics of Ecosystem Development " put forth by Odum (1969). Our project is part of a long-term research programme on " Stability Criteria of Forest Eco-systems " coordinated by the University of Giittingen. We report on the qC0, of microbial communities of 137 forest stands. With the exception of one stand, all were located in Northern Germany (Lower Saxony). The experiment included comparison between stands with different litter inputs (Fagus and Picea), chronosequences (stands of different ages) and comparison between simple (Fugus, Picea) and mixed (Fugu.s-Quercu.r) forest ecosys-tems. Soil samples were taken exclusively in early spring (beginning of March) before the emergence of ground-cover. The Oh and Ah (O-5 cm) horizons were sampled separately. Soils were stored unsieued in the cold (4\textdegree C) to minimize microbial death during storage. During the following 5 months of experimentation, maximal losses due to storage reached 10\% for Ah samples and 25\% for Oh samples, when comparing the initial biomass contents of 10 soils (of each horizon) to the biomass contents after 5 months, respectively. From each site, five samples were taken and bulked. Three replicates from the bulk sample were used for microbial biomass or respiration determinations. Before measurements, the soils were sieved ({$<$} 2 mm) and adjusted to a water potential of -240 kpa (range 50-70\% w/w for Oh and 30-50\% w/w for Ah samples). Soil samples, 10 (Oh) to 25 g (Ah) (dry weight), were used for each analysis, respectively. The substrate-induced respiration (SIR) tech-nique was employed for microbial biomass measurements (C,) (Anderson and Domsch, 1978), wherein CO, was analysed with an automated infrared-gas analyser system (Heinemeyer et al., 1989). The amount of glucose applied for obtaining a maximal CO, flush in all soils was 8000 pg g-i. The qC0, (unit CO,-C unit-' C,, h-i) was determined as described by Anderson and Domsch (1986). CO, evolution from basal respiration (soil without glucose-amendent) was followed until soils had reached a relatively constant CO*-production rate at 22\textdegree C. This occurred in general after 20 h. The mean of the basal CO* output of the following 10 h was taken for calculating qC0,. Soil pH was determined in 1 M KC1 and soil organic C by dry combustion (Leco). We found that total microbial biomass together with microbial CO,-production rates were far lower (on average 64\% for C, or 49\% for COr evolution, respectively) in acidic soil conditions than at neutral pH. At the same time, however, with respect to the specific respiration rate (qC0,) of Ah samples the prevalent soil pH strongly al\&ted the respiratory activity of soil microorganisms. As demon-strated in Fig. 1 (a, b) for Fugus and Fugw-Quercw forests, respectively, microbial communities released more CO,-C per unit microbial biomass and time under acidic soil conditions than communities at a more neutral pH range. Wolters (1991) also reported an increase in the qC0, of a beech wood (Of layer) following acid-rain treatment. All of the Picea stands had a very low soil pH (range 2.2-3.2; n = 26). Table 1 shows a comparison between qC0, of spruce stands to beech or beech-oak stands all of a similar low pH range (2.7-3.2). In spite of the different ages or substrate qualities of the primary producers, in these low pH environments the metabolic quotients for CO, were very close (qC0, = 2.3 ng pg-i Cd h-i) with the excep tion of the mixed forests (beech-oak) which showed a slightly lower mean qC02 of 2.0 ng pg-' C, h-l. Unfortu-nately, at neutral pH conditions, only a few stands of Fugus-Quercus forests have been available to make a useful comparison. Table 1.

Soil ecosystem analyses concentrated first on the quantification of the element and energy transfer between pools. Since mineralization of organic substrates and the release of nutrients and elements are due to the heterotrophic activity of the microbial decomposer compartment, this subsystem of terrestrial ecosystems gained importance. Direct microscopic observation methods were inadequate for the quantification of environmental impacts on the microflora. We adopted the maintenance requirement concept for the quantification of environmental impacts or stress effects on the soil microbial community. The paper gives a brief inside to the concept of maintenance from autecological studies and describes the underlying points which lead to our experimental approach of its application at the synecological level (i.e., microbial biomass as a single ecological entity) - a process which rested on long-term continuous research. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Our objective was to quantify macroaggregate ({$>$} 250 lm) rebuilding in soils from loess (Haplic Luvisol) with different initial soil organic C (SOC) contents and different amendments of organic matter (OM) in a short term incubation experiment. Two soils differing in C content and sampled at 0\textendash 5 and 5\textendash 25 cm soil depths were incubated after macroaggregate destruction. The following treatments were applied: (1) control (without any addition), (2) OM 1 (addition of OM: preincubated wheat straw [{$<$} 10 mm, C : N 40.6] at a rate of 4.1 g C [kg soil] \textendash 1), and (3) OM 2 (same as (2) at a rate of 8.2 g C [kg soil] \textendash 1). Evolution of CO 2 released from the treatments was measured continuously, and contents of different water-stable aggregate-size classes ({$>$} 250 lm, 250\textendash 53 lm, {$<$} 53 lm), microbial biomass, and ergosterol were determined after 7 and 28 d of incubation. Highest microbial activity was observed in the first 3 d after the OM application. With one exception, {$>$} 50\% of the rebuilt macroaggregates were formed within the first 7 d after rewetting and addi-tion of OM. However, the amount of organic C within the new macroaggregates was {$\approx$} 2-to 3-fold higher than in the original soil. The process of aggregate formation was still proceeding after 7 d of incubation, however at a lower rate. Contents of organic C within macroaggregates were decreased markedly after 28 d of incubation in the OM 1 and OM 2 treatments, suggesting that the microbial biomass (bacteria and fungi) used organic C within the newly built macroag-gregates. Overall, the results confirmed for all treatments that macroaggregate formation is a rapid process and highly connected with the amount of OM added and microbial activity. How-ever, the time of maximum aggregation after C addition depends on the soil and substrate inves-tigated. Moreover, the results suggest that the primary macroaggregates, formed within the first 7 d, are still unstable and oversaturated with OM and therefore act as C source for microbial decomposition processes.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare the effects of repeated field applications of three urban compost amendments and one farmyard manure amendment over a 9-year period on aggregate stability in a silty loam soil initially characterized by low clay and initial organic matter contents and poor aggregate stability. Three different aggregate stability tests with increasing disruptive intensities (fast wetting {$>$} mechanical breakdown {$>$} slow wetting tests) and different disaggregation mechanisms, were used. All of the amendments, which were applied at approximately 4Mg C ha -1 every other year, increased the organic carbon content and improved the stability of the aggregates against the disruptive action of water, as determined by each of the stability tests. However, the year-to-year variations in the aggregate stability that related to factors other than the organic inputs were greater than the cumulative increase in aggregate stability relative to the control. The positive effects of the tested amendments on aggregate stability were linked to their contribution to soil organic C contents (r = 0.54 for the fast wetting test and r = 0.41-0.42 for the mechanical breakdown and slow wetting tests; p {$<$} 0.05). The addition of urban composts had a larger positive effect on aggregate stability than farmyard manure at the majority of sampling dates. The addition of biodegradable immature compost, such as municipal solid waste (MSW), improved the aggregate stability through an enhanced resistance to slaking. The addition of mature composts, such as the co-compost of sewage sludge and green wastes (GWS) or biowaste compost (BW), improved the aggregate stability by increasing interparticular cohesion. The MSW compost was the most efficient in improving aggregate stability during the first 6 years of the experiment (average improvements of +22\%, +5\% and +28\% in the fast wetting, mechanical breakdown and slow wetting tests, respectively, compared to the control treatment); this result was likely due to the larger labile organic pool of the MSW compost that was highly effective at stimulating soil microbial activity. After the first 6 years, the two other composts, GWS and BW, became more efficient (average improvements of +25\%, +61\% and +33\% in the fast wetting, mechanical breakdown and slow wetting tests, respectively, compared to the control treatment), which was probably linked to the greater increase in soil organic C contents. Therefore, the application of urban compost to silty soil that is susceptible to water erosion was effective at improving aggregate stability and thus could be used to enhance the resistance of soil to water erosion. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Combination of position-specific 13C labeling with compound-specific 13C-PLFA analysis is a novel tool to trace metabolic pathways. This combination was used to analyze short-term transformations (3 and 10 days after tracer application) of two key monosaccharides: glucose and ribose in soil under field conditions. Transformations of sugars were quantified by the incorporation of 13C from individual molecule positions in bulk soil, microbial biomass (by CFE) and in cell membranes of microbial groups classified by 13C-PLFA.The 13C incorporation in the Gram negative bacteria was higher by one order of magnitude compared to all other microbial groups. All of the 13C recovered in soil on day 3 was allocated in microbial biomass. On day 10 however, a part of the 13C was recovered in non-extractable microbial cell components or microbial excretions. As sugars are not absorbed by mineral particles due to a lack of charged functional groups, their quick mineralization from soil solution is generally expected. However, microorganisms transformed sugars to metabolites with a slower turnover. The 13C incorporation from the individual glucose positions into soil and microbial biomass showed that the two main glucose utilizing pathways in organisms - glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway - exist in soils in parallel. However, the pattern of 13C incorporation from individual glucose positions into PLFAs showed intensive recycling of the added 13C via gluconeogenesis and a mixing of both glucose utilizing pathways. The pattern of position-specific incorporation of ribose C also shows initial utilization in the pentose phosphate pathway but is overprinted on day 10, again due to intensive recycling and mixing. This shows that glucose and ribose - as ubiquitous substrates - are used in various metabolic pathways and their C is intensively recycled in microbial biomass.Analyzing the fate of individual C atoms by position-specific labeling deeply improves our understanding of the pathways of microbial utilization of sugars (and other compounds) by microbial groups and so, of soil C fluxes.},

  abstract = {The effects of applications of food waste and paper waste vermicomposts on some soil chemical and biological properties were evaluated in field plots planted with strawberries. Six-week old strawberries (Fragaria ananasa, var. Chandler) were transplanted into 4.5 m2 raised beds under a plastic tunnel structure measuring 9.14 \texttimes{} 14.6 \texttimes{} 3.6 m. Vermicompost were applied at rates of 5 or 10 t ha-1 supplemented with inorganic fertilizers to balance fertilizer recommendations for strawberries of 85-155-125 kg NPK ha-1. Effects of vermicomposts on strawberry growth and yields have been reported previously [Arancon, N.Q., Edwards C.A., Bierman P., Welch, C., Metzger, J.D., 2004. The influence of vermicompost applications to strawberries: Part 1. Effects on growth and yield. Bioresource Technology 93:145-153]. Total extractable N, NH4-N, NO3-N and orthophosphates did not differ significantly between treatments, except on the last sampling date (harvest date) in which significantly greater amounts of NH4-N, NO3-N and orthophosphates (P {$\leq$} 0.05) were recorded in vermicompost-treated soils than in the controls. Two major results of vermicompost applications to soils were increases in dehydrogenase activity and microbial biomass-N which were not dose-dependent. Increased dehydrogenase activity and microbial biomass-N was correlated positively with the increased amounts of NH4-N, NO3-N and orthophosphates in the vermicompost-treated plots than in the controls. Increases in microbial populations and activities are key factors influencing rates of nutrient cycling, production of plant growth-regulating materials, and the build-up of plant resistance or tolerance to crop pathogen and nematode attacks. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Agricultural practices can influence soil microbial communities, which are the primary regulators of soil carbon and nutrient cycling processes. Differences in microbial community composition have the potential to affect the fate of carbon and nutrients during decomposition and may therefore influence the retention of C and provisioning of crop nutrients in agroecosystems. Long term management-induced shifts in microbial communities and resource availability may interact to affect the microbial utilization of fresh inputs of crop residues in the short term, with lasting impacts on soil C accrual and fertility. The objective of this study was to investigate whether long-term organic and conventional management resulted in differences in microbial residue decomposition. Soils under conventional and organic management planted with annual crops or with a mix of annual crops and three years of perennial alfalfa were collected from a long-term (19 y) field study in Saskatchewan, Canada and were incubated in the laboratory with and without 13C-labelled barley residues for 98~d. We measured extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) and the incorporation of crop residue-derived C within major microbial groups (fungi, actinobacteria, and Gram positive and negative bacteria) during decomposition. Total PLFA biomass and EEAs were highest in soils from the conventional-annual system, similar between the conventional and organic perennial systems, and similar or lowest in the organic-annual system. Crop residue additions alleviated these differences; that is, in residue-amended soils total PLFA biomass, EEAs, and the abundance of the fungal biomarker increased in the organic systems compared to the unamended soils to become similar to the conventional systems. In contrast, residue additions induced small or no changes in biomass and EEAs in the conventional-annual soils. Using 13C-PLFA-SIP we showed that the general pattern of microbial succession during decomposition was similar among soils, but that fungi and especially actinobacteria were relatively more dominant in organic compared to conventionally managed soils during early and later stages of decomposition, respectively. Thus, shifts in the decomposer community composition were greater in soils originating from organic management, possibly as a result of larger changes in resource availability during the incubation that advanced the rate of microbial succession. This may reinforce long term differences in SOC quality and nutrient availability between management regimes. Organically-managed cropping systems are particularly reliant on biological cycling of organic nutrients to support crop growth. This work reinforces the importance of adequate crop residue returns for maintaining soil function, particularly where external organic amendments are not applied to balance nutrients exported as crop products.},

  abstract = {Long-term contrasts in agricultural management can shift soil resource availability with potential consequences to microbial carbon (C) use efficiency (CUE) and the fate of C in soils. Isothermal calorimetry was combined with 13C-labeled glucose stable isotope probing (SIP) of 16S rRNA genes to test the hypothesis that organically managed soils would support microbial communities with greater thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional soils due to a legacy of lower resource availability and a resultant shift toward communities supportive of more oligotrophic taxa. Resource availability was greater in conventionally managed soils, with 3.5 times higher available phosphorus, 5\% more nitrate, and 36\% more dissolved organic C. The two management systems harbored distinct glucose-utilizing populations of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, with a higher Proteobacteria:Actinobacteria ratio (2.4 vs. 0.7) in conventional soils. Organically managed soils also harbored notable activity of Firmicutes. Thermodynamic efficiency indices were similar between soils, indicating that glucose was metabolized at similar energetic cost. However, differentially abundant glucose utilizers in organically managed soils were positively correlated with soil organic matter (SOM) priming and negatively correlated to soil nutrient and carbon availability, respiration, and heat production. These correlation patterns were strongly reversed in the conventionally managed soils indicating clear differentiation of microbial functioning related to soil resource availability. Fresh C addition caused proportionally more priming of SOM decomposition (57 vs. 51\%) in organically managed soils likely due to mineralization of organic nutrients to satisfy microbial demands during glucose utilization in these more resource deprived soils. The additional heat released from SOM oxidation may explain the similar community level thermodynamic efficiencies between management systems. Restoring fertility to soils with a legacy of nutrient limitation requires a balanced supply of both nutrients and energy to protect stable SOM from microbial degradation. These results highlight the need to consider managing C for the energy it provides to \i critical biological processes that underpin soil health.},

  abstract = {Soil health refers to the biological, chemical, and physical features of soil that are essential to long-term, sustainable agricultural productivity with minimal environmental impact. Thus, soil health provides an overall picture of soil functionality. Although it cannot be measured directly, soil health can be inferred by measuring specific soil properties (e.g. organic matter content) and by observing soil status (e.g. fertility). There is also increased interest in studying soil microorganisms in their particular environments, as microbial diversity is intimately related to soil structure and function. One of the key objectives in determining soil health is to acquire indicators that can be used to evaluate the soil's current status and hence to develop sustainable agricultural systems. In this regard, significant progress has been made over the last few years in the development of specific biomarkers and macromolecular probes, enabling rapid and reliable measurements of soil microbial communities. In addition, modern molecular biological techniques, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), have facilitated the analysis of microbial biodiversity and activity, whereas the application of modern analytical techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and pyrolysisgas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), have provided data on soil chemistry. The combination of these two approaches offers promise in determining soil health status.},

The objectives of this study were: (i) to assess the effect of cultivation on soil aggregation and aggregate stability and (ii) to determine the effect of cultivation on total SOM, and the quantity and quality of POM in a Rhodic Nitisol at Munesa, in southeastern Ethiopia. Samples were collected from a cropland cultivated for 26 years and an adjacent natural forest. After cultivation, the proportion of water-stable macroaggregates was significantly reduced from {$>$}70\% in the natural forest soil to 50\% in the cultivated soil, being more pronounced in the {$>$}1 mm size aggregates. Cultivation also induced significant losses of OC and N both in bulk soil and water-stable aggregates. The amounts of free light fraction (free LF) C and N were more affected by cultivation than the amounts of intraparticulate organic matter (iPOM) C and N. The effect of cultivation was more pronounced on macroaggregate associated total and particulate organic matter than on microaggregate-associated fractions. The losses of POM C and N due to cultivation were highest in comparison to the total aggregate and whole soil OC and N suggesting that POM constitutes a more sensitive SOM fraction to the effects of cultivation. Soil aggregate stability and SOM could be used as indicators to apply the more appropriate management practices for increasing soil sustainability or productivity. \# 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

We present an approach of step-wise fragmentation to assess the role that microbes and organic matter have on soil aggregate stabilisation. Compared to slaking and ultrasound procedures, the approach has a low impact on the microbial biomass. It also does not impose a severe drying stress. Grassland soil was found to be more stable than arable soil. Further examination of the arable soil revealed that increased disruption by shaking caused unstable microaggregates 53-250 {$\mu$}m in size to fragment, leaving a higher proportion of stable microaggregates in this size range. Carbohydrates, C:N, and basal respiration were found to be higher in the stable microaggregates than the other size fractions. Our results indicate that a distinct size range of soil aggregates exists in which microbial stabilisation dominates. This contradicts other research and questions the usefulness of measuring the biological properties of aggregate size fractions without understanding the physical effects of the fractionation procedure. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The inclusion of a cover crop in a corn bioenergy system could provide additional biomass, mitigating the negative effects of residue removal by adding to stable soil C pools. In a no-till continuous corn bioenergy system in the northern US Corn Belt, we used 13CO2 pulse labeling to trace plant C from a winter rye (Secale cereale) cover crop into different soil C pools for 2 years following rye cover crop termination. Corn stover left as residue (30\% of total stover) contributed 66, corn roots 57, rye shoots 61, rye roots 50, and rye rhizodeposits 25 g C m-2 to soil. Five months following cover crop termination, belowground cover crop inputs were three times more likely to remain in soil C pools than were aboveground inputs, and much of the root-derived C was in mineral-associated soil fractions. After 2 years, both above- and belowground inputs had declined substantially, indicating that the majority of both root and shoot inputs are eventually mineralized. Our results underscore the importance of cover crop roots vs. shoots and the importance of cover crop rhizodeposition (33\% of total belowground cover crop C inputs) as a source of soil C. However, the eventual loss of most cover crop C from these soils indicates that cover crops will likely need to be included every year in rotations to accumulate soil C.},

  abstract = {Intensive agriculture (IA) is widespread in South Italy, although it requires frequent tillage, large amounts of fertilizers and irrigation water. We have assessed the efficacy of reversing IA to sustainable agriculture (SA) in recovering quality of a typical South Italy soil (Lithic Haploxeralf). This reversion, lasting from 2000 to 2007, replaced 75\% of nutrients formerly supplied inorganically by farmyard manuring and reduced the tillage frequency. Several chemical and biochemical properties, functionally related to C and N mineralisation-immobilisation processes and to P and S nutrient cycles, were monitored annually from 2005 to 2007 in the spring. Reversing IA to SA decreased soil bulk density, almost doubled the soil organic matter (SOM) as favoured the immobilisation of C and N, increased most soil microbial indicators but decreased contents of nitrate, mineral N and K(2)SO(4)-extractable C. The K(2)SO(4)-extractable C/K(2)SO(4)-extractable organic N ratio suggested that substrate quality rather than the mass of readily available C and N affected biomass and activity of soil microflora. Also, the largely higher 10-day-evolved CO(2)-C-to-inorganic N ratio under SA than IA indicated that higher C mineralisation, associated with higher microbial biomass N immobilisation, occurred under SA than IA. Decreases in most soil enzyme activities under IA, compared to SA, were much higher than concomitant decreases in SOM content. Soil salinity and sodicity were always higher in IA than SA soil, although not critically high, likely due to the intensive inorganic fertilisation as irrigation waters were qualitatively and quantitatively the same between the two soils. Thus, we suggest that the cumulative small but long-term saline (osmotic) and sodic (dispersing) effects in IA soil decreased the microbial variables more than total organic C and increased soil bulk density.},

  abstract = {Fungi and bacteria govern most of the transformations and ensuing long-term storage of organic C in soils. We assessed the relative contributions of these two groups of organisms to the microbial biomass and activity of soils from five different ecosystems with treatments hypothesized to enhance soil C sequestration: (1) desert (an elevation gradient allowed comparison of soil developed in a cooler, moister climate with soil developed in a warmer, drier climate), (2) restored tallgrass prairie (land reverted to native prairie in 1979 and neighboring land farmed to row crops for {$\sim$} 100 year), (3,4) two forest types (Douglas fir and loblolly pine, unfertilized control and N-fertilized plots), and (5) agricultural land (conventional- and no-till management systems). The selective inhibition technique, using captan (fungicide) and oxytetracycline hydrochloride (bactericide), was used to determine the activities (respiration) of fungi and bacteria in each of these soils and substrate-induced respiration was used to measure total active soil microbial biomass C. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis was used to determine the composition of the soil microbial biomass and determine if the activities and structure of the microbial communities were related. Differences in fungal-to-bacterial (F:B) activities between treatments at a site were greatest at the prairie sites. The restored prairie had the highest F:B (13.5) and high total C (49.9 g C kg-1 soil); neighboring soil farmed to corn had an F:B of 0.85 and total C of 36.0 g C kg-1 soil. Within the pairs of study soils, those that were tilled had lower fungal activities and stored C than those that were managed to native or no-till systems. In all pairs of soils, soils that had higher absolute fungal activities also had more total soil C and when two extreme cases were removed fungal activity was correlated with total soil C (R2 = 0.85). Thus, in this small set of diverse soils, increased fungal activities, more than F:B ratios, were associated with increased soil C. Practices that involved invasive land management decreased fungal activity and stored soil C compared to similar soils that were less intrusively managed. \textcopyright{} 2002 Baltelle.

The HWEOM fraction exhibited a higher H/C ratio and higher O-alkyl C proportion than the soil from which it was extracted. It also had a 30 to 40\% lower C/N ratio than the whole soil. The relative proportion of O-alkyl C in the HWEOM increased with soil depth in the forest fl oor, while alkyl C decreased, contrary to the pattern observed for the whole soil. The spectral and elemental properties of HWEOM present in these acidic Spodosols support the hypothesis that HWEOM is largely a mixture of carbohydrates and proteins.

  abstract = {Natural organic materials in soils consist of a complex mixture of different biochemicals exhibiting numerous morphologies and stages of biological oxidation. A continuum of decomposability exists based on chemical structure; however, this continuum can be altered by interactions with minerals within matrices capable of stabilising potentially labile organic matter against biological oxidation. Protection is not considered to equate to a permanent and complete removal of organic C from decomposition, but rather to a reduced decomposition rate relative to similar unprotected materials. The stabilisation of organic materials in soils by the soil matrix is a function of the chemical nature of the soil mineral fraction and the presence of multivalent cations, the presence of mineral surfaces capable of adsorbing organic materials, and the architecture of the soil matrix. The degree and amount of protection offered by each mechanism depends on the chemical and physical properties of the mineral matrix and the morphology and chemical structure of the organic matter. Each mineral matrix will have a unique and finite capacity to stabilise organic matter. Quantifying the protective capacity of a soil requires a careful consideration of all mechanisms of protection and the implications of experimental procedures.},

  abstract = {Soils of coniferous forest ecosystems are important for the global carbon cycle, and the identifica- tion of active microbial decomposers is essential for understanding organic matter transformation in these ecosystems. By the independent analysis of DNA and RNA, whole communities of bacteria and fungi and its active members were compared in topsoil of a Picea abies forest during a period of organic matter decomposition. Fungi quantitatively dominate the microbial community in the litter horizon, while the organic horizon shows comparable amount of fungal and bacterial biomasses. Active microbial populations obtained by RNA analysis exhibit similar diversity as DNA-derived populations, but significantly differ in the composition of microbial taxa. Several highly active taxa, especially fungal ones, show low abundance or even absence in the DNA pool. Bacteria and especially fungi are often distinctly associated with a particular soil horizon. Fungal communities are less even than bacterial ones and show higher relative abundances of dominant species. While dominant bacterial species are distributed across the studied ecosystem, distribution of dominant fungi is often spatially restricted as they are only recovered at some locations. The sequences of cbhI gene encoding for cellobiohydrolase (exocellulase), an essential enzyme for cellulose decomposition, were compared in soil metagenome and metatranscriptome and assigned to their producers. Litter horizon exhibits higher diversity and higher proportion of expressed sequences than organic horizon. Cellulose decomposition is mediated by highly diverse fungal populations largely distinct between soil horizons. The results indicate that low-abundance species make an important contribution to decomposition processes in soils.},

Two long-term treatments (direct drilling and conventional mouldboard ploughing for 22 years) were compared with short-term direct drilling and broadcast sowing plus rotavation for 5 years. Carbohydrate released sequentially to cold water, hot water, 1.0 M HCl and 0.5 M NaOH was determined after hydrolysis as reducing sugar equivalent to glucose in both fresh and air-dried samples. All other measurements were made on dry soils only. About 3\% of the soluble carbohydrate was extracted by cold water, 10\% by hot water, 12\% by HCl and 75\% by NaOH from both the dry and fresh soils. The total reducing sugars of the fractions were proportional to the total organic carbon determined by dichromate oxidation or C analysis. Organic carbon and carbohydrates were concentrated near the surface of the direct drilled soil, but were more uniformly distributed with depth in the ploughed soil. The surface soil under direct drilling was more stable, less compactible and had greater plasticity limits than under ploughing. However, particle size distributions were unaffected by tillage so that differences in soil properties were attributed to differences in the quantity and quality of organic matter. Differences in compactibility, structural stability and plasticity limits between depths and tillage treatments correlated with total carbon and with total carbohydrates. The hot water extractable carbohydrate fraction correlated best with aggregate stability and the NaOH fraction correlated best with compactibility and plastic limit. Both fractions were greatest in the long term direct drilled soil. The hot water fraction had a galactose plus mannose over arabinose plus xylose ratio of 1.0-1.6 in comparison to 0.4-0.7 in the NaOH fraction indicating that the microbial contribution within the hot water soluble fraction was the greater. The hot-water fraction was likely to contain more exocellular microbial polysaccharides involved in the stabilizing of soil aggregates. The hot-water and NaOH carbohydrate fractions may be good indicators of soil organic matter quality relevant to the preservation of good soil physical conditions.},

This study tested the usefulness of measures of soil microbial biomass and fungal:bacterial biomass ratios as indicators of effective conversion from an intensive grassland system, reliant mainly on fertilisers for crop nutrition, to a low-input system reliant mainly on self-regulation through soil biological pathways of nutrient turnover. Analysis of soils from a wide range of meadow grassland sites in northern England,along a gradient of long-term management intensity, showed that fungal:bacterial biomass ratios (measured by phospholipid fatty acid analysis; PLFA) were consistently and significantly higher in the unfertilised than the fertilised grasslands. There was also some evidence that microbial biomass, measured by chloroform fumigation and total PLFA, was higher in the unfertilised than in the fertilised grasslands. It was also found that levels of inorganic nitrogen (N), in particular nitrate-N, were significantly higher in the fertilised than in the unfertilised grasslands. However, microbial activity, measured as basal respiration, did not differ between the sites. A field manipulation trial was conducted to determine whether the reinstatement of traditional management on an improved mesotrophic grassland, for years, resulted in similar changes in the soil microbial community. It was found that neither the cessation of fertiliser applications nor changes in cutting and grazing management significantly affected soil microbial biomass or the fungal:bacterial biomass ratio. It is suggested that the lack of effects on the soil microbial community may be related to high residual fertility caused by retention of fertiliser N in the soil. On the basis of these results it is recommended that following the reinstatement of low-input management, the measurement of a significant increase in the soil fungal:bacterial biomass ratio, and perhaps total microbial biomass, may be an indicator of successful conversion to a grassland system reliant of self-regulation.},

An understanding of soil microbial ecology is central to our ability to assess terrestrial carbon cycle-climate feedbacks, but the complexity of the soil microbial community and the many ways that it can be affected by climate and other global changes hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions on this topic. In this paper, we argue that to understand the potential negative and positive contributions of soil microbes to land-atmosphere carbon exchange and global warming requires explicit consideration of both direct and indirect impacts of climate change on microorganisms. Moreover, we argue that this requires consideration of complex interactions and feedbacks that occur between microbes, plants and their physical environment in the context of climate change, and the influence of other global changes which have the capacity to amplify climate-driven effects on soil microbes. Overall, we emphasize the urgent need for greater understanding of how soil microbial ecology contributes to land-atmosphere carbon exchange in the context of climate change, and identify some challenges for the future. In particular, we highlight the need for a multifactor experimental approach to understand how soil microbes and their activities respond to climate change and consequences for carbon cycle feedbacks.},

A large fraction of soil organic matter (OM) resists decomposition over decades to centuries as indicated by long radiocarbon residence times, but the mechanisms responsible for the long-term (multi-decadal) persistence are debated. The current lack of mechanistic understanding limits our ability to accurately predict soil OM stock evolution under climate and land-use changes. Using a unique set of historic soil samples from five long-term (27\textendash 79~years) bare fallow experiments, we demonstrate that despite wide pedo-climatic diversity, persistent OM shows specific energetic signatures, but no uniform chemical composition. From an energetic point of view, thermal analyses revealed that combustion of persistent OM occurred at higher temperature and provided less energy than combustion of more labile OM. In terms of chemical composition, persistent OM was H-depleted compared to OM present at the start of bare fallow, but spectroscopic analyses of OM functional groups did not reflect a consistent chemical composition of OM across sites, nor substantial modifications with bare fallow duration. The low energy content of persistent OM may be attributed to a combination of reduced content of energetic C\textendash H bonds or stronger interactions between OM and the mineral matrix. Soil microorganisms thus appear to preferentially mineralize high-energy OM, leaving behind material with low energy content. This study provides the first direct link between long-term persistence of OM in soil and the energetic barriers experienced by the decomposer community.},

N was added at three different rates: 0, 5.44, and 27.2gNm−2y−1. In both studies, Schizachyrium scoparium was the dominant plant species before N treatments were applied. Soil microbial communities from each experiment were characterized using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis. Discriminant analysis of the FAMEs separated the three N fertilizer treatments in both experiments, indicating shifts in the composition of the microbial communities. In general, plots that received N fertilizer at low or high application rates for 18 years showed increased proportions of bacterial FAMEs and decreased fungal FAMEs. In particular, control plots contained a significantly higher proportion of fungal FAMEs C18:1(cis9) and C18:2(cis9,12) and of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) FAME, C16:1(cis11), than both of the N addition treatment plots. A significant negative effect of N fertilization on the AMF FAME, C16:1(cis11), was measured in the short-term experiment. Our results indicate that high rates of anthropogenic N deposition can lead to significant changes in the composition of soil microbial communities over short periods and can even disrupt the relationship between AMF and plants.},

  abstract = {Soil aggregation and organic carbon accumulation are two intrinsically linked phenomena. Soils under natural vegetation and conservation tillage systems generally have higher aggregation indices and total organic carbon (TOC) stocks in the surface layers than soils under conventional management (ploughing). From the point of view of the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), C stabilization and loss in the surface layer is relevant. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) on TOC stabilization and loss through soil aggregation in the topsoil. Soil aggregation, TOC stocks, and fluxes of CO2 of samples from a Rhodic Ferralsol under NT and CT in a long-term field experiment in Southern Brazil were measured. A natural forest site was also evaluated as reference to the management sites. Emissions of CO2 were measured in laboratory incubation experiment on bulk soil samples and on soil aggregate size fractions, previously separated by dry sieving, in intact and destroyed (crushed to {$<$}0.250 mm) state. The soil under NT had larger aggregates and larger proportion of the soil in greater aggregate size classes than CT. Total organic carbon stocks were higher under NT both in bulk soil samples and macroaggregates than under CT. Under laboratory conditions the bulk soil samples from NT showed higher emission rates of CO2 (CO2BS = 18.3 kg C ha-1 h-1) than from CT (CO2BS = 2.3 kg C ha-1 h-1) due to the overall higher TOC stocks. The TOC that was lost by CO2 emission due to the oxidation of readily decomposable macroaggregate-protected SOM in NT ({$\Sigma\Delta$}CO2 = 79.4 kg C ha-1 h-1) was, however, also higher than under CT (CT: {$\Sigma\Delta$}CO2 = 29.1 kg C ha-1 h-1). The TOC stabilized by macroaggregation in NT was also more than the TOC lost by CO2 emission from the bulk soil ({$\Sigma\Delta$}CO2-CO2BS = 61.1 kg C ha-1 h-1), and the difference between these two was higher under NT than under CT ({$\Sigma\Delta$}CO2-CO2BS = 26.8 kg C ha-1 h-1), showing that NT in fact accumulates more TOC in the soil by protecting it within the macroaggregates. The natural forest had higher TOC stock and emission rates than the tilled soils, however it also stabilized more TOC. Thus, no-tillage in its effect on carbon stabilization, is between the natural ecosystem and CT, representing a soil management system that seems to be an efficient on the way path to the recuperation of soil after conventional management systems. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One reason for this is the stabilisation within the soil matrix, but recycling, i.e. the reuse of "old" organic material to form new biomass may also play a role as it uncouples the residence times of organic matter from the lifetime of discrete molecules in soil. We analysed soil sugar dynamics in a natural 30 years old labelling experiment after a\textasciitilde wheat-maize vegetation change to determine the extent of recycling and stabilisation in plant and microbial derived sugars: while plant derived sugars are only affected by stabilisation processes, microbial sugars may be subject to both, stabilisation and recycling. To disentangle the dynamics of soil sugars, we separated different density fractions (free particulate organic matter (fPOM), light occluded particulate organic matter ({$\leq$}1.6 g cm-3; oPOM1.6), dense occluded particulate organic matter ({$\leq$}2 g cm-3; oPOM2) and mineral-associated organic matter ({$>$}2 g cm-3; Mineral)) of a\textasciitilde silty loam under long term wheat and maize cultivation. The isotopic signature of sugars was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (HPLC/IRMS), after hydrolysis with 4 M Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). While apparent mean residence times (MRT) of sugars were comparable to total organic carbon in the bulk soil and mineral fraction, the apparent MRT of sugars in the oPOM fractions were considerably lower than those of the total carbon of these fractions. This indicates that oPOM formation was fuelled by microbial activity feeding on new plant input. In the bulk soil, mean residence times of the mainly plant derived xylose (xyl) were significantly lower than those of mainly microbial derived sugars like galactose (gal), rhamnose (rha), fucose (fuc), indicating that recycling of organic matter is an important factor regulating organic matter dynamics in soil.},

We studied priming effects and microbial utilization of glucose as an example of bioavailable labile molecule in the carbon cycle of a semiarid soil. The soil, which has low content of total organic carbon (5.0 g kg\`A1), was amended with U13C-glucose (99 atom \%) at concentration of 75 mg C g\`A1 soil (LD) or 300 mg C g\`A1 soil (HD). Glucose-derived carbon remained in soil after two months of incubation. The percentage of residual carbon stabilized was greater in LD with 40\% of the initial 13C added compared to 30\% of the initial 13C added in the HD. Comparison of 13C content in waterand sodium-pyrophosphate extracts pointed to a significant humification of up to 2.4\% of the initial 13Cglucose. Glucose was subjected to an intense mineralization in the first 17-days of 22.8\% and 40.94\% for the LD and HD, respectively. The stable isotope probing (SIP) of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) by gaschromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) showed that bacteria dominated glucose metabolism in comparison to fungi. Gram-negative populations were initially more involved in glucose assimilation than Gram-positive bacteria. In the fatty acids fraction, up to 95\% of the 13C was predominantly found in fatty acids typical for Gram-negative bacteria. However, after 4 and 17 days the 13C-enrichment in Gram-positive biomarkers increased. The mineralization of soil organic matter triggered by glucose additions was more intense in HD (3.6\% of soil TOC) than LD (1.0\% of soil TOC) and reached the highest level after 4 days in HD. Priming was controlled by Gram-negative populations but fungi and, particularly actinobacteria played an important role in latter steps. Our data indicated that the intense metabolism of SOM due to priming phenomena compromises the potential carbon sequestration in this semiarid soil amended with glucose.},

  abstract = {Bacterial densities, metabolic signatures and genetic structures were evaluated to measure the impact of soil enrichment of soluble organic carbon on the bacterial community structures. The exudates chosen were detected in natural maize exudates (glucose, fructose, saccharose, citric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, alanine, serine and glutamic acid) and were used at a rate of 100 mg C g21 day21 for 14 days. Moreover two synthetic solutions with distinct carbon/nitrogen ratios (20.5 and 40.1), obtained by varying carboxylic and amino acids concentrations, were compared in order to evaluate the potential role of organic N availability. The in vitro experiment consisted of applying exudate solutions to bulk soil. In the case of the control, only distilled water was added. Both solutions significantly increased bacterial densities and modified the oxidation pattern of Biologw GN2 plates with no effect of the C/N ratio on these two parameters. Genetic structure, measured by means of ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA), was also consistently modified by the organic amendments. N availability levels led to distinct genetic structures. In a second experiment, one of the previous exudate solutions (C/N 20.5) was applied to 15-day-old maize plants to determine the structural influence of exudates on the rhizosphere microbial community (in situ experiment). Bacterial densities were significantly increased, but to a lesser extent than had been found in the in vitro experiment. Metabolic potentials and RISA profiles were also significantly modified by the organic enrichment.},

  abstract = {Soil biodiversity has become a major area of research over the last decade, and the literature on the topic has expanded tremendously in recent years, so much so that a huge number of publications now deal with soil biodiversity every year. This article does not attempt the formidable task of drawing a general picture of where the field is at the moment, but it zeroes in instead on two perspectives that seem to have gathered momentum over time and raise concern about future progress. The first perspective involves the implicit assumption that to make sense of either the species-, genetic-, or functional biodiversity of soils, it is not necessary to consider in detail the features of (micro)habitats provided by soils to organisms, and that analysis of the information provided by extracted DNA or RNA suffices. The second perspective is associated with research on the effect of the physical and chemical characteristics of microhabitats on the activity of microorganisms. It basically hypothesizes that all microorganisms behave similarly, and therefore that observations made mostly with bacteria can be extended readily to all organisms, ignoring taxonomic biodiversity. To illustrate both perspectives, we provide a number of illustrative examples from the relevant literature and analyze them briefly. We argue that these two perspectives, if they spread, will hinder progress in our understanding of soil biodiversity at any level, and especially of its impact on soil processes. In order to return to a more fruitful middle ground, where both a variety of organisms and the characteristics of the microhabitats where they reside are carefully considered, several routes can be envisaged, but our experience suggests that an emphasis on genuinely interdisciplinary research is crucial.},

  abstract = {Hydraulic conductivity of soil is strongly dependent on soil structure, which can be degraded during wetting and leaching. It was hypothesised that this structural degradation is dependent on initial aggregate size distribution and soil texture. The general aim of this study was to investigate the effects of aggregate sizes and soil textures, and their interactions, on the structural degradation and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(s)) of smectitic soils under different saline and sodic conditions. The studied soils were clay and loamy sand soils with low (similar to 4.5) or high (similar to 10) exchangeable sodium percentages (\{ESP)\}, and with aggregate sizes in the ranges: (i) \{\textbackslash textless\}1mm (small aggregates); or (ii) 2-4mm (large aggregates). The Ks values of the samples in a column after slow or fast pre-wetting were determined by means of a constant head device. Different wetting rates and leaching under various saline and sodic conditions had no effect on the Ks of the loamy sand; however, the Ks values of this soil with large aggregates were an order of magnitude greater than those of the soil with small aggregates. In contrast, in the clay soil with large aggregates, the Ks values after fast pre-wetting were significantly smaller than those after slow pre-wetting, probably because of aggregate slaking. No significant effects of the wetting rates on Ks were found in clay soil with small aggregates. An increase in the \{ESP\} in the clay soil decreased the Ks by a factor of 1.5 for the large aggregates and by an order of magnitude for the small aggregates, mainly as a result of increased clay swelling. Leaching the clay soil with deionised water significantly decreased the Ks values, partly because of clay dispersion. Although significant structural degradation of the clay soil occurred during leaching, the Ks values were smaller in the soils with small aggregates than in those with large aggregates, indicating the importance of the initial aggregate size on Ks even in soils that are prone to structural damage.},

Differences in soil C pools under row crop production and uncultivated soils may provide information about soil C sequestration. The impact of agroforestry consisting of poplar with wheat, rice\textendash wheat, maize\textendash wheat and sugarcane agro-ecosystems on total organic carbon (TOC) and labile pools, viz. water-extractable (WEOC), hot water-soluble (HWC), KMnO4-oxidizable, microbial biomass and mineralizable C; and organic C fractions of different oxidizability was studied at 22-sites for each land use. Cultivation resulted in decrease in TOC (21\textendash 36\%) and dehydrogenase activity (by 2.8\textendash 3.4 mg kg-1 soil h-1) compared to uncultivated soils. Labile C pools, except WEOC, were correlated (P b 0.05), though the amount extracted by different methods varied considerably suggesting that each method enumerated different fractions of TOC. Agroforestry and sugarcane systems were characterized by very labile C compared with uncultivated soils and the soils under rice\textendash wheat and maize\textendash wheat systems. Conversely, uncultivated soils and the soils under maize\textendash wheat and rice\textendash wheat held greater proportion of organic C in recalcitrant fractions. Results suggest that soil organic C (SOC) pools in agroforestry and sugarcane systems could be decomposed under land use alterations. However, no single soil C pool alone was suitable as a sensitive indicator for land use induced changes in SOM. A composite of soil indicators encompassing labile C, KMnO4-oxidizable C, non-labile and recalcitrant C, mineralizable C, basal soil respiration, and dehydrogenase activity could distinguish different land use systems.},

  abstract = {The effect of crop residue and soil organic matter (SOM) quality on the functional characteristics of soil microbial communities was investigated. Five shoot and root materials with contrasting biochemical qualities were incorporated into soil taken from a cultivated field (FC) and a field edge (FE). These soils had contrasting native SOM qualities, with organic C contents of 0.9 and 2.5\%, respectively. The amended soils were incubated under controlled environment conditions before the metabolic characteristics of the soil microbial community were determined by analysis of the activities of 19 hydrolytic enzymes, by substrate utilization within Biolog GN microplates, and C and N mineralization dynamics. For enzyme and Biolog data, metabolic diversity and community level physiological profiles (CLPP) were determined by calculating Shannon's diversity index and performing canonical variate analysis, respectively. Soil type significantly affected mineralization of N from the residues, although the size and direction of the effect varied according to the crop residue material added. Both enzyme and Biolog metabolic diversity were affected by the type of crop residue incorporated. Enzyme diversity was higher in FE relative to FC soil, but soil type had no effect on metabolic diversity recorded in Biolog microplates. There were significant interactions between soil type and crop residue material for respiration, N mineralization and enzyme diversity. During the early stages of decomposition, there were similarities in the response of enzyme and Biolog CLPP to crop residue quality and soil type. In the high OM soil, there was evidence for convergence of CLPP in treatments receiving low and high quality crop residue types. However, in the low SOM soil, CLPP of low and high quality crop residue treatments were clearly different. The length of time required for the CLPP of residue amended soil to converge with that of unamended control soil depended on both residue and soil type. We conclude that both crop residue and SOM quality can affect the functional diversity of the soil microbial community, and that enzyme and Biolog analyses reflect complementary, but not inter-changeable, analyses. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Removal of harvesting residues had negative effects on the abundances of animals at higher trophic positions and on more mobile animals. Predators such as gamasid mites, spiders and staphyliniid and cantharid beetles decreased by 30{$\pm$}50\% after WTH at both sites. Microbidetritivorous dipterans and fungivorous Collembola decreased at the pine site, but not at the more productive spruce site. Enchytraeids and nematodes were usually not affected by WTH. No differences in fungal and bacterial biomass were found. The removal of organic matter had fairly long-term, of the order of decades, effects on the soil food web. The effects were quantitative rather than qualitative. No functional groups disappeared after WTH. Our \textregistered ndings do not support the hypothesis that soil food webs are entirely donor-controlled. The more pronounced effects of WTH at higher trophic positions indicates that the major interactions in the food webs we have studied are reciprocal, i.e., that consumers to some degree control the density of their resources. \#},

Secondary succession in these heathlands was studied by comparing the amounts of soil organic matter, above-gound biomass, below-ground biomass and the annual nitrogen mineralization in plots of different ages. (2) The amounts of organic matter in the L and FH layers increased with age while the communities were dominated by Calluna vulgaris or Erica tetralix. Where dwarf shrubs were replaced by Molinia caerulea the amount of soil organic matter did not further increase. (3) Both above-ground and below-ground biomass in the communities dominated by dwarf shrubs increased with age to about 1300 and 800 g m\textsuperscript{-2}, respectively, but were much lower in the Molinia-dominated plots (c. 400 and 500 g m\textsuperscript{-2}). (4) The annual nitrogen mineralization remained at a low level, or even decreased, during the first ten years after turf removal. Thereafter the mineralization rate increased with an increasing amount of organic matter in the L and FH layers. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the amount of organic matter in the L and FH layers and the biomass percentage of Molinia together explained 84\% of the observed variance in the annual nitrogen mineralization. It is proposed that Molinia has a positive effect on the mineralization rate. (5) In communities dominated by Calluna or Erica all the nitrogen that entered the ecosystem appeared to accumulate in the plant biomass and the soil organic matter, whereas losses of nitrogen from the ecosystem appeared to be negligible. In Molinia-dominated communities part of the nitrogen that entered the system was lost to deeper soil layers, to the atmosphere or to herbivores.},

In this review, recent studies on the influence of the two factors, plant species and soil type, on rhizosphere-associated microbial communities are discussed. Root exudates and the response of microorganisms to the latter as well as to root morphology were shown to shape rhizosphere microbial communities. All studies revealed that soil is the main reservoir for rhizosphere microorganisms. Many secrets of microbial life in the rhizosphere were recently uncovered due to the enormous progress in molecular and microscopic tools. Physiological and molecular data on the factors that drive selection processes in the rhizosphere are presented here. Furthermore, implications for agriculture, nature conservation and biotechnology will also be discussed.},

The waste mixtures were composted by the Rutgers static pile system, and four samples of each mixture were collected at various composting stages: the initial mixture, and samples taken during the thermophilic phase, at the end of the active phase and after maturation. These samples were added to a calcareous silt loam soil at a rate of 200 mg per 10 g soil, and the CO2-C evolution was determined during 70 days of aerobic incubation at 28\textdegree C. Carbon mineralization decreased as the composting time lengthened. The lowest values of C mineralization were found for the mature samples, and only a compost which had not attained an advanced degree of maturation gave results higher than 25\% of TOC. Carbon mineralization followed a combined first- and zero-order kinetic model in most of the samples, suggesting that the organic C of the composting wastes was made up of two organic pools of differing degrees of stability. However, the differences in the slow C mineralization pool at the end of the active phase and after maturation were very small, indicating that the organic matter at both stages was of a similar microbial stability. Comparing the C mineralization which takes place in soil and during composting, it can be concluded that composting is the best way of obtaining maximum C stabilization, which is an important factor in soil conservation and reclamation.},

Replicated experimental treatments include corn (maize)\textendash soybean\textendash wheat cropping systems under four different management regimes: (a) conventional tillage and fertilizer/chemical inputs (Conventional), (b) no tillage with conventional fertilizer/chemical inputs (No-till), (c) conventional tillage with {$\sim$}30\% of conventional fertilizer/chemical inputs and a leguminous cover crop (Reduced Input), and (d) conventional tillage with no fertilizer/chemical input and a leguminous cover crop (Organic). Effects of these treatments on soils were compared by developing a soil quality index (SQI) from 19 selected soil health indicators. An old field community maintained in early succession provided a benchmark for comparison. Reduction in tillage or fertilizer (No-till, Reduced Input and Organic) resulted in increased SQI and improved crop production. The No-till (SQI = 1.02) and Reduced Input (SQI = 1.01) systems outperformed Conventional management (SQI = 0.92) in nitrogen availability and use efficiency, soil stability and structure improvement, and microbial nitrogen processing. Improvements in soil quality corresponded with increased primary production and crop yield in these systems, illustrating the value of an ecologically defined SQI for assessing the long-term effects of fertility and tillage management regimes in agricultural production systems.},

  abstract = {Recent empirical and theoretical advances inform us about multiple drivers of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and microbial responses to warming. Absent from our conceptual framework of how soil respiration will respond to warming are adequate links between microbial resource demands, kinetic theory, and substrate stoichiometry. Here, we describe two important concepts either insufficiently explored in current investigations of SOM responses to temperature, or not yet addressed. First, we describe the complete range of responses for how warming may change microbial resource demands, physiology, community structure, and total biomass. Second, we describe how any relationship between SOM activation energy of decay and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stoichiometry can alter the relative availability of C and N as temperature changes. Changing availabilities of C and N liberated from their organic precursors can feedback to microbial resource demands, which in turn influence the aggregated respiratory response to temperature we observe. An unsuspecting biogeochemist focused primarily on temperature sensitivity of substrate decay thus cannot make accurate projections of heterotrophic CO2 losses from diverse organic matter reservoirs in a warming world. We establish the linkages between enzyme kinetics, SOM characteristics, and potential for microbial adaptation critical for making such projections. By examining how changing microbial needs interact with inherent SOM structure and composition, and thus reactivity, we demonstrate the means by which increasing temperature could result in increasing, unchanging, or even decreasing respiration rates observed in soils. We use this exercise to highlight ideas for future research that will develop our abilities to predict SOM feedbacks to climate.},

The treatments included fresh paper mill sludge (PMS) and its compost (CPMS) applied at a rate of 40 Mg ha(-1) with or without a mineral N fertilizer (120 kg N ha(-1)), N fertilizer only (recommended rate of 160 kg N ha(-1)), and an unamended control. Measurements of total and amino sugars and humic substances were made on slaking-resistant aggregates 2 yr after the last of three successive annual applications of the treatments. Compared with the treatments that received no organic amendment, the PMS and CPMS applications increased macroaggregate stability by an average of 45\%. The effects of fresh vs. composted amendments on soil macroaggregates and their organic C contents were similar but differences in C composition were observed. Humic acid content of aggregates {$>$}2 mm was significantly higher (50\%) with CPMS than PMS, although part of this effect could be attributed to the slightly greater C application rate with CPMS. Conversely, glucosamine content, an indicator of fungi abundance, was significantly greater following PMS than CPMS application. We concluded that microorganisms, in particular fungi, were a more important factor of stable macroaggregation in the soil amended with fresh sludge, while humic substances played a greater role in compost-amended soil. These effects were long lasting in the field since they were still noticeable 2 yr after the last application.},

  abstract = {Crusting and erosion of cultivated soils result from aggregate breakdown and the detachment of soil fragments by rain, and the susceptibility of soil to these processes is often inferred from measurements of aggregate stability. Here, theories of aggregate breakdown are reviewed and four main mechanisms (i.e. slaking, breakdown by differential swelling, mechanical breakdown by raindrop impact and physico\textendash chemical dispersion) are defined. Their relative importance depends on the nature of the rain, as well as on the soil's physical and chemical properties. The relations between aggregate breakdown, crusting and water erosion are analysed, and existing methods for the assessment of aggregate stability are reviewed. A unified framework for the measurement of aggregate stability is proposed to assess a soil's susceptibility to crusting and erosion. It combines three treatments having various wetting conditions and energies (fast wetting, slow wetting, and stirring after pre-wetting) and measures the resulting fragment size distribution after each treatment. It is designed to compare different soils, or different climatic conditions for a given soil, not to compare time-dependent changes in that soil.},

The length of fungal hyphae and abundance of bacterial cells were determined by direct counting at 19 sample dates during the fourth (1997), fifth (1998) and sixth (1999) application years. Bacterial abundance was significantly greater in manured soil than in fertilized and untreated soils. In contrast, hyphal length was significantly greater in untreated soil than in manured and fertilized soils. In subplots that ceased to receive manure in 1998, bacterial abundance remained greater through 1998 and 1999 than in previously fertilized plots, indicating that the 4 year cumulative effect of manure was detectable for at least two growing seasons after applications cease. The apparently negative effect of manure and fertilizer on fungal hyphae also appeared to persist through 2 years after applications ceased. Bacterial abundance increased after an initial application of manure for 1 year to previously untreated plots, but not to levels comparable to plots treated with manure continuously from 1994 to 1998. Increases in bacterial abundance, during the one to three week intervals immediately following individual applications of manure, were inconsistent and other factors, such as soil moisture, temperature and perhaps crop phenology appear to have had strong effects on the timing of these microbial responses. Annual means for bacterial abundance and total microbial biomass in the continuous manure treatment were similar for all 3 years. This suggested that the manure-induced increase in microbial biomass probably reached a plateau between one and 3 years after applications commenced. The large bacterial populations along with abundant carbon substrates in manured soil, relative to fertilized soil, were probably capable of immobilizing influxes of mineral N, explaining the observations that less leaching occured from manured than from fertilized soils.

  abstract = {We propose and successfully applied a new approach for 3-source-partitioning based on a combination of 14C labeling with 13C natural abundance. By adding 14C-labeled glucose to soil after C3 e C4 vegetation change, we partitioned three C sources in three compartments, namely CO2, microbial biomass and dissolved organic C (DOC). This enabled us to estimate mechanisms and sources of priming effects (PE). Glucose application at low and high rate (GL: 100 and GH: 1000 mg C g\`A1, respectively) caused positive PE both short-term (during 1e3 days) and long-term (3e55 days). Despite a 10-fold difference in the amount of substrate added, the PE observed was larger by a factor of only 1.6 at the high versus low rate of glucose. The real and apparent priming effects were distinguished by partitioning of microbial C for glucose-C and SOM-derived C. As the amount of primed CO2 respired during short-term PE was 40\% lower than microbial C, and the contribution of soil C in microbial biomass did not increase, we concluded that such short-term PE was apparent and was mainly caused by accelerated microbial turnover (at GL) and by pool substitution (at GH). Both the amount of primed CO2eC, which was 1.3e2.1 times larger than microbial C, and the increased contribution of soil C in microbial biomass allowed us to consider the longterm PE as being real. The sole source of real PE (GL treatment) was the ``recent'' soil organic matter, which is younger than 12-year-old C. The real PE-induced by a glucose amount exceeding microbial biomass (GH) was due to the almost equal contribution of `recent' ({$<$}12 years) and `old' ({$>$}12 years) C. Thus, the decomposition of old recalcitrant SOM was induced only by an amount of primer exceeding microbial C. We conclude that combining 14C labeling with 13C natural abundance helped disentangle three C sources in CO2, microbial biomass and DOC and evaluate mechanisms and sources of PE.},

Despite the importance of active microorganisms, most methods focus on estimating total microbial biomass and fail to evaluate its active fraction. At first, we have described the differences among the active, potentially active, and dormant microbial states in soil and suggested threshold values of parameters for their identification. Secondly, we critically reviewed the ability of a broad range of approaches to estimate and characterize the active and the potentially active microorganisms in soil. Following approaches were evaluated: plate count and microbial cultures; direct microscopy combined with cell staining; ATP, PLFA, DNA and RNA content; microarray analyses; PCR-based approaches; stable isotope probing; soil proteomics, enzymes activity; and various approaches based on respiration and substrate utilization. The ``static'' approaches, mainly based on the single-stage determination of cell components (ATP, DNA, RNA, and molecular biomarkers), detect well the presence of microorganisms and total biomass, but they fail to evaluate the active part and consequently the functions. In contrast, the dynamic approaches, estimating the changes of these parameters during microbial growth and based on process rates: substrate utilization and product formation, e.g., respiration, help to evaluate active microbial biomass and relate it to specific process rates. Based on a comparison of all approaches for their universality (possibility to analyze active, potentially active and dormant microorganisms), we concluded that 1) direct microscopy with complementary stains, 2) a combination of RNA-based FISH with staining of total microbial biomass, and 3) approaches based on microbial growth were the most advantageous and allowed simultaneous quantitative estimation of active, potentially active, and dormant microorganisms in soil.},

A mix of biotic (e.g., plant C input, microbial activity) and abiotic factors (e.g., water, mineral interactions) contribute to form macroaggregates. However, in order to better model and manage soil macroaggregates, we need to know more about the relative contributions of these mechanisms. Previous experiments to separate microbial and abiotic mechanisms have been hampered by the need to add sterilant dissolved in water, thus limiting our ability to draw conclusions about the role of soil moisture in controlling aggregation and preventing conclusions about dry soil. Our first goal was to quantify the contribution of plant growth (and fresh plant C inputs) by continuously removing plants for 2 years in a seasonally dry grassland. Our second goal was to quantify microbial vs. abiotic contributions to macroaggregate formation under a range of soil moisture conditions by using chloroform vapor to sterilize soil without adding water or destroying soil structure. In the field, regardless of dry season length, removing plants reduced the average size of soil aggregates by 22-33\%, which was primarily driven by a shift from large macroaggregates (2-9 mm diameter) to small macroaggregates (0.25-2 mm). In the laboratory, in sterile soils macroaggregate production increased with the moisture content. The resulting physicogenic aggregates appeared planar and angular at both macro- and micro-scales. In contrast, biogenic aggregates were formed most at intermediate moisture levels and were spherical. Our results suggest that-even in dry climates-soil macroaggregates are preserved by the presence of even dead plant roots, but are engineered by live microbes.},

The mineralisation rate of the native C and the CStraw was high. The formation of macroaggregates ({$>$}2000 ␮m) occurred within 2 days in amended and unamended samples but did so to a greater extent in the amended samples. The CStraw was mainly located in fractions {$>$}200 ␮m, where degraders were the most abundant. The 13C-FAME profiles followed the same trends as total FAME profiles through time and within soil fractions, suggesting common dynamics between straw degraders and total bacterial communities: Gram-negative were more important in fraction {$>$}200 ␮m and during the early stages of the incubation while Gram-positive and actinobacteria dominated in fine fractions and at the end of the incubation. Bacterial community structure changed rapidly (within 2 days) in conjunction with the formation of new microbial habitats, suggesting that the relationship between the two is very close.},

Their rates of turnover after release into the soil remain poorly understood. We extracted soil solution from a temperate grassland Eutric Cambisol, isotopically labeled the glucose and amino acid components, and then re-injected the solution back into the soil. We followed the subsequent evolution of 14CO2 and incorporation of the LMW C into the soil microbial biomass or grasses for 48 h. The experiments were performed both on grazed and un-grazed swards in the field, and in the laboratory. In the field, we showed that glucose and amino acids had short half-lives (t1/2) in soil solution (t1/2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 20\textendash 40 min), but that they persisted in soil microbes for much longer. A first-order double exponential model fitted the experimental data well and gave rate constant (k) values of 1.21\textendash 2.14 h\`A1 for k1 and 0.0025\textendash 0.0048 h\`A1 for k2. Only small amounts of the added 14C were recovered in plant biomass (o5\% of total added to soil) indicating that plant roots are poor competitors for LMW dissolved organic C (DOC) in comparison to soil microorganisms. The first phase of glucose and amino acid mineralization in the laboratory was slower (t1/2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 40\textendash 60 min) than measured in the field reinforcing the importance of making flux measurements in situ. Whilst grazing stimulated below-ground respiration, it exerted only a small influence on the turnover of LMW DOC suggesting that the increase in respiration was due to increased root respiration and not turnover of soil organic matter (SOM). Our results suggest that some components of the LMW DOC pool are turned over extremely rapidly (ca. 4000 times annually).},

  abstract = {An understanding of agroecosystems is the key to estimate the influence of agricultural production methods on the environment, including soil, water and air quality. The present study aimed to contribute to the insufficient knowledge of functional and structural soil microbial properties influenced by organic and inorganic fertilisation and climatic conditions at two European long-term field experiments. Soil microbial biomass, activities of alkaline phosphatases, {$\beta$}-glucosidases and proteases, and phospholipid fatty acid profiles were evaluated in soils from three different fertiliser treatments (inorganic, NPK; farmyard manure, FYM; without, CON) at two sites (Bad Lauchst\"adt, Germany and Keszthely, Hungary). The results showed that Corg and N t concentrations were significantly higher in the FYM plots compared to the NPK amendments or CON. Furthermore, increases were observed in the C mic and the enzyme activities of FYM-fertilised treatments in the soil at Bad Lauchst\"adt. NPK fertilisation significantly decreased C mic in the soil at Keszthely, whereas FYM increased the activity of {$\beta$}-glucosidases. Ecophysiological parameters (Cmic-to-C org and qCO2) revealed a clear climatic influence on edaphic properties. The profiles of 28 phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were used to assess whether observed changes in functional microbial parameters were accompanied by changes in the composition of the microbial communities after FYM and NPK amendments. The results of principal component analyses indicate that the communities of the autochthonous microflora differed between the two sites and three treatments. Bacteria, particularly Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes were responsible for these differences. The results support the hypothesis that fertilisation in general and its forms (organic versus inorganic) affect important functional and structural soil microbial properties. PLFA analysis proved to be a more sensitive indicator than functional parameters. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is defined as the organic matter fraction in solution that passes through a 0.45 mm filter. Although DOM is ubiquitous in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, it represents only a small proportion of the total organic matter in soil. However, DOM, being the most mobile and actively cycling organic matter fraction, influences a spectrum of biogeochemical processes in the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Biological fixation of atmospheric CO2 during photosynthesis by higher plants is the primary driver of global carbon cycle. A major portion of the carbon in organic matter in the aquatic environment is derived from the transport of carbon produced in the terrestrial environment. However, much of the terrestrially produced DOM is consumed by microbes, photo degraded, or adsorbed in soils and sediments as it passes to the ocean. The majority of DOM in terrestrial and aquatic environments is ultimately returned to atmosphere as CO2 through microbial respiration, thereby renewing the atmospheric CO2 reserve for photosynthesis. Dissolved organic matter plays a significant role in influencing the dynamics and interactions of nutrients and contaminants in soils and microbial functions, thereby serving as a sensitive indicator of shifts in ecological processes. This chapter aims to highlight knowledge on the production of DOM in soils under different management regimes, identify its sources and sinks, and integrate its dynamics with various soil processes. Understanding the significance of DOM in soil processes can enhance development of strategies to mitigate DOM-induced environmental impacts. This review encourages greater interactions between terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemists and ecologists, which is essential for unraveling the fundamental biogeochemical processes involved in the synthesis of DOM in terrestrial ecosystem, its subsequent transport to aquatic ecosystem, and its role in environmental sustainability, buffering of nutrients and pollutants (metal(loid)s and organics), and the net effect on the global carbon cycle.},

However, previous studies question if a constant efficiency is appropriate, in particular when evaluating carbon (C) cycling across temperatures and various substrates. In the present study, we evaluated the relation between substrate use efficiency, microbial community composition and substrate complexity in contrasting long-term management regimes (47\textendash 49 years of either arable, ley farming, grassland, or forest systems). Microbial community composition was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid analysis and three indices of substrate use efficiencies were considered: (i) thermodynamic efficiency, (ii) calorespirometric ratio, and (iii) metabolic quotient. Three substrates, d-glucose, l-alanine, or glycogen, varying in complexity, were added separately to soils, and heat production as well as C mineralization was determined over a 32-h incubation period at 12.5 \textdegree C. Microbial communities from forest systems were most efficient in utilizing substrates, supporting our hypothesis that maturing ecosystems become more efficient. These changes in efficiency were linked to microbial community composition with fungi and Gram-negative bacteria being important biomarkers. Despite our initial hypothesis, complex substrate such as glycogen was utilized most efficiently. Our findings emphasize that differences in land use management systems as well as the composition of soil organic matter need to be considered when modelling C dynamics in soils. Further research is required to establish and evaluate appropriate proxies for substrate use efficiencies in various ecosystems.},

This research was conducted to study the effect of cultivation on the distribution of soil macro- and microaggregates as related to changes in soil organic matter content in a Typic Haplustoll, located in central Cordoba, the principal peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) growing area of Argentina. Samples were taken from A or Ap horizons at (1) an undisturbed and (2) a cultivated site for determination of the aggregate fractions by the wet sieving method. The mineral associated organic carbon (MOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC), in soils and their aggregates, were separated by dispersion and sieving procedures. Carbohydrate content in soil and in aggregate fractions was determined by dilute acid (CHda) and hot water (CHhw) extraction, whereas humic (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) were extracted by the NaOH method. The results indicated that the total macroaggregates ({$>$}250{$\mu$}m) content was 1.7 times lower in the cultivated than in the undisturbed soil. The large macroaggregates (2800\textendash 2000{$\mu$}m) were the most affected, decreasing a 92\% due to cultivation compared with undisturbed. In contrast, the microaggregate (250\textendash 53{$\mu$}m) content was twice that high in the cultivated than in the undisturbed soil. The concentrations of OC, POC, CHda, CHhw were all reduced substantially by cultivation, with the microaggregates showing an almost complete loss of its POC content. The destruction of these transient organic cementing agents was assumed to have contributed to the collapse of the macroaggregates. This has resulted in exposure of POC, making it more available to rapid oxidation and microbial attack. There were indications suggesting POC and CHhw contents to be valuable as indicators of soil structure degradation due to exhaustive cultivation practices. Although it is well know that humic substances are chemically and structurally much more stable than nonhumic substances but our results showed a surprising decrease humic substances under continuous cultivation.},

Hotspot treatments of decreasing patchiness were established by filling laboratory microcosms with defaunated soil and adding labelled (13C, 15N) grass residues as 1-layer, 4-layer or completely mixed within the soil. Microfaunal treatments were set up by inoculation of the soil with either protozoa or bacterivorous nematoaes, a combination of both or neither (control). The microcosms were planted with surface sterile ryegrass seedlings. Growth of ryegrass plants was enhanced by both, increasing patchiness of the organic matter in soil (1-layer {$>$} 4-layer {$>$} mixed) and microfloral-microfaunal interactions (protozoa + nematodes = protozoa {$>$} nematodes {$>$} control). The presence of microfauna enhanced the decomposition of hotspot material. Protozoan grazing in particular increased the availability of N in soil and leaching water and led to a concomitant increase in plant growth. While root foraging in organic hotspots enhanced the spatial coupling of mineralization and plant uptake, microfaunal grazing increased the temporal coupling of nutrient release and plant uptake. Consequently the greatest plant biomass was found in treatments combining aggregation of organic material in patches and the presence of microfauna. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Recent study is exposing the soil microbial community as not only decomposing SOM, but also providing the primary source of chemicals for its formation. All else equal, SOM formation is theoretically greatest when microbes maximise enzyme efficiency (ratio of enzyme activity to carbon loss from respiration) and biomass efficiency (biomass gain per unit substrate added). Our study examines the relationship between microbial composition and metrics of these two efficiencies. We hypothesised that both will increase with higher ratios of soil fungi to bacteria. We manipulated microbial composition through sustained use of selective microbial inhibitors in microcosms with tropical soil, alongside variation of litter quality and diversity and the presence or absence of a simulated root exudate. Both litter and inhibitor treatments significantly changed soil microbial composition and function, and enzyme efficiency and biomass efficiency were both higher in microbial communities with more fungi, supporting our hypothesis. Structural equation modelling suggested that the observed efficiency changes did indeed occur in part via changes in microbial composition after accounting for direct effects of treatments. Taken together the results provide some support for the hypothesis that soil fungi benefit SOM formation.},

Samples were taken from topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (27-40 cm depth) and analysed for concentrations of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), organic C, total N and pH. The results showed that the subsoil samples reflected the total PLFA content of the topsoil, but not the microbial community structure. Total PLFA content was well correlated with total organic C and total N in both topsoil and subsoil. Total PLFA content in topsoil samples was highest in the sewage sludge treatment (89 A +/- 22 nmol PLFA g dw(-1)). This contradicts earlier findings on microbial biomass in this sewage sludge-treated soil, which indicated inhibition of microorganisms, probably by heavy metals added with sludge. A switch towards microbial growth and faster decomposition of organic matter occurred around 2000, coinciding with lowered heavy metal content in the sludge. According to the PLFA data, the microbial community in the sewage sludge treatment is now dominated by Gram-positive bacteria. A lack of Gram-negative bacteria was also observed for the ammonium sulphate treatment, obviously caused by a drop in pH to 4.2.},

The objectives of the present work were: (a) to propose a protocol for using LD to study soil aggregation, (b) to study the aggregation of an Acrisol under the influence of different doses and forms of lime. Samples were collected in 2005 from a Brazilian Acrisol that in 1994 had received 0.0; 2.0; 8.5 and 17.0 Mg ha-1 of lime, left on the soil surface or incorporated. Aggregates from 4.76 to 8.00 mm diameters were studied using the traditional method proposed by Kemper \& Chepil (1965), with wet sieving, while aggregates from 1.00 to 2.00 mm were studied using a CILAS\textregistered{} laser diffractometer that distinguishes particles ranging from 0.04 to 2,500.00 {$\mu$}m. LD readings were made after six consecutive pre-treatments, using agitation times, a chemical dispersion agent and ultrasound. Mean Weighted Diameter (MWD) and the Aggregate Stability Index (ASI) calculated, using the traditional method does not discriminate the treatments. However, LD is able to produce detailed data on soil aggregation, resulting in indexes of stability of aggregates that are linearly related to the doses of lime applied (MWD: R{$^2$} = 0.986 and ASI: R{$^2$} = 0.876). It may be concluded that electrochemical changes in the Brazilian Acrisol resulting from incorporated lime affect the stability of aggregates, increasing stability with increased doses of lime.},

Here we describe an approach to directly link specific environmental microbial processes with the organisms involved, based on the stable-carbon-isotope labelling of individual lipid biomarkers. We demonstrate this approach in aquatic sediments and provide evidence for the identity of the bacteria involved in two important biogeochemical processes: sulphate reduction coupled to acetate oxidation in estuarine and brackish sediments(3,4), and methane oxidation in a freshwater sediment(5). Our results suggest that acetate added in a C-13- labelled form was predominantly consumed by sulphate-reducing bacteria similar to the Gram-positive Desulfotomaculum acetoxidans and not by a population of the more widely studied Gram-negative Desulfobacter spp. Furthermore, C-13-methane labelling experiments suggest that type I methanotrophic bacteria dominate methane oxidation at the freshwater site.},

However, the magnitude of the effects can vary with soil properties and season. The aim of this study was to investigate AS dynamics over three seasons in a soil under various tillage and fertilization practices. The study was performed under three tillage practices (moldboard plowing (MP), surface tillage (ST) and no-tillage (NT)) and two types of fertilizer (poultry manure and mineral) seven and eight years after their establishment in Northwest France. AS was measured in three different seasons: spring, summer and winter. Soil properties that potentially influence AS such as organic carbon (OC), hot-water extractable carbohydrates (HWEC), water content (WC) and water repellency (WR) were also studied. On average, for all sampling dates, AS was 34\% higher under NT than MP. Conversely, the effect of ST on AS varied with sampling date with values close to NT in mid-spring and summer, and values close to MP in early spring and winter. Poultry manure increased AS by an average of 12\% regardless of sampling date or tillage practice. Variations in AS due to management practices were related to OC (r = 0.92) and HWEC (r = 0.88). Differences in AS between sampling dates were slightly greater than the effects of management practices. On average across management practices, AS increased by 47\% from early spring to summer and decreased by 59\% in winter. These variations were related to soil WC (r = -0.67) and WR (r = 0.72) at time of sampling. We suggest that seasonal variations in AS were at least partly due to variations in WC which acted physically by modifying the water entry rate into the aggregates and slaking effects. In contrast, the long-term AS dynamics were related to the organic matter dynamics, which are controlled by management practices. Because of the predominant effect of climate on AS, we suggest measuring AS in winter and summer to better estimate the effects of management practices on soil erodibility in this region.},

The carbon and nitrogen of the microbial biomass (BC and BN) were studied using the fumigation-extraction method. For the two cultivated and uncultivated plots, BN and BC were more important in the superficial profile (0?20 cm) than in the deep one (20? 40 cm). In the uncultivated soil, we observed a good linear relation between BC and BN at the level of upper soil horizon during the wet season with r coefficients of 0.95, 0.71 and 0.80 for the consecutive years 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Microbial biomasses C and N increased during the rainy season and decreased during the dry season. Microbial biomass C and N showed the higher content with compost and farmyard manure at 40 tonnes ha?1. Moreover, the results showed that at the beginning of the experiment, the microbial biomass was higher in the ploughed wheat-cultivated plot than in the uncultivated one. Microbial biomass C and N in the cultivated plot amended with compost at 40 tonnes ha?1 were significantly different in comparison with the soil microbial biomass amended with farmyard manure. The combining of chemical fertilizer with the organic fertilizer, such as compost at 40 or 80 tonnes ha?1 and farmyard manure, increased the microbial biomasses C and N after 1 and 2 years. In the cultivated or uncultivated plots the results revealed that the best application rate of the compost was 40 tonnes ha?1 and when the compost rate was increased from 40 to 80 tonnes ha?1 both BC and BN decreased significantly.},

Decomposition of SOM is mediated by energy-requiring processes that need extracellular enzymes produced by soil microbial communities. We examined how an increase in energy status via sucrose supplementation affects the production of SOM-degrading enzymes, comparing matched soils under forest and sugarcane agriculture with histories of contrasting inputs of complex and labile C. Activities of SOM-degrading enzymes increased in both soils after sucrose addition, but CO2 production increased more rapidly in the sugarcane soil. The forest soil had greater increases in phosphatase and glucosidase activities, whereas the sugarcane soil had greater increases in protease and urease activity. The contrasting microbial community-level physiological profiles of the soils further diverged at 30 and 61 days after sucrose amendment, before returning to near pre-treatment profiles by 150 days.

  abstract = {Plant-carbon inputs to soils in the form of dissolved sugars, organic acids and amino acids fuel much of heterotrophic microbial activity below-ground. Initial residence times of these compounds in the soil solution are on the order of hours, with microbial uptake a primary removal mechanism. Through microbial biosynthesis, the dissolved compounds become dominant precursors for formation of stable soil organic carbon. How the chemical class (e.g. sugar) of a dissolved compound influences stabilization in field soils is unknown and predictions from our understanding of microbial metabolism, turnover and identity are contradictory. We show that soil carbon formation, from chronic amendments of dissolved compounds to fertilized and unfertilized grasslands, is 2.4-times greater from a sugar than an amino acid. Formation rates are negatively correlated with respiration rates of the compounds, and positively correlated with their recovery in microbial biomass. These relationships suggest that the efficiency of microbial growth on a compound is positively related to formation rates of soil organic carbon. Fertilization does not alter these findings, but together nitrogen and phosphorus additions reduce soil carbon formation. Our results highlight the need to consider both nutrient enrichment and global-change induced shifts in the form of dissolved root inputs to soils to predict future soil carbon stocks and hence phenomena such as climate warming and food security to which these stock sizes are intimately tied.

In the first experiment, 14C-labelled glucose was added to two soils at seven rates ranging from 36 to 2304 {$\mu$}g C g-1 soil. An average of 42\% of added 14C was mineralized by day 3 at glucose rates {$\geq$}288 {$\mu$}gCg-1 soil in both soils, but this proportion declined at lower rates. Only 30\% of added 14was mineralized at the lowest rate of glucose addition. The fraction of soil 14C released by fumigation-extraction (FE-14C) ranged from 11 to 36\%, and decreased linearly with the proportion of 14C mineralized in both soils. The effects of addition rate persisted until the end of the experiment, at 35 days. In the second experiment, addition of unlabelled glucose at 6, 24 or 72 h after addition of glucose-14C at 30 {$\mu$}g C g-1 soil did not appreciably affect the proportion of 14C mineralized, while addition 72 h before or immediately after 14C addition increased 14C mineralization by about 50\%. Fumigation-labile 14C was reduced in all cases by addition of unlabelled glucose, with the greatest reduction when unlabelled glucose was added immediately after glucose-14C. We conclude that assimilated glucose-14C was incompletely metabolized at low rates of glucose addition unless soil microorganisms were 'activated' by a prior addition of glucose. The proportion of 14C mineralized at low rates of glucose addition to soils may be useful as an indicator of C availability: a small proportion mineralized may indicate low C availability whereas a large proportion mineralized may indicate high C availability. \textcopyright{} 1994.},

  abstract = {Soil structure exerts important influences on the edaphic conditions and the environment. It is often expressed as the degree of stability of aggregates. Aggregation results from the rearrangement, flocculation and cementation of particles. It is mediated by soil organic carbon (SOC), biota, ionic bridging, clay and carbonates. The complex interactions of these aggregants can be synergistic or disruptive to aggregation. Clay-sized particles are commonly associated with aggregation by rearrangement and flocculation, although swelling clay can disrupt aggregates. Organo-metallic compounds and cations form bridges between particles. The SOC originates from plants, animals and microorganisms, and their exudates. It enhances aggregation through the bonding of primary soil particles. The effectiveness of SOC in forming stable aggregates is related to its decomposition rate, which in turn is influenced by its physical and chemical protection from microbial action. Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) increases aggregation in arid and semi-arid environments, and the formation of secondary carbonates is influenced by the presence of SOC and Ca2+ and Mg 2+. Soil biota release CO2 and form SOC which increase dissolution of primary carbonates while cations increase precipitation of secondary carbonates. The precipitation of (hydr)oxides, phosphates and carbonates enhances aggregation. Cations such as Si4+, Fe 3+, Al3+ and Ca2+ stimulate the precipitation of compounds that act as bonding agents for primary particles. Roots and hyphae can enmesh particles together while realigning them and releasing organic compounds that hold particles together, a process with a positive impact on soil C sequestration. Soil structure can be significantly modified through management practices and environmental changes. Practices that increase productivity and decrease soil disruption enhance aggregation and structural development. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Summary-A new ``direct extraction'' method for measuring soil microbial biomass nitrogen (biomass N) is described. The new method (fumigation-extraction) is based on CHCI, fumigation, followed by immediate extraction with 0.5 M \&SO, and measurement of total N released by CHCl, in the soil extracts. The amounts of NH,-N and total N extracted by K,SO, immediately after fumigation increased with fumigation time up to 5 days. Total N released by CHClr after 1 day fumigation (1 day CHCIr-N) and after 5 days fumigation (5 day CHCl,-N) were positively correlated with the flush of mineral N (FN) in 37 soils that had been fumigated, the fumigant removed and the soils incubated for 10 days(fumigation-incubation). The regression equations were 1 day CHCI,-N = (0.79 \& 0.022) F, and 5 day CHCl,-N = (1.01 \& 0.027) F,, both regressions accounting for 92\% of the variance in the data. In field soils previously treated with r5N-Iabelled fertilizer, the amounts of labelled N, measured after fumigation-extraction, were very similar to the amounts of labelled N mineralized during fumigation-incubation; both were about 4 times as heavily labelled as the soil N as a whole. These results suggest that fumigation extraction and fumigation-incubation both measure the same fraction of the soil organic N (probably the cytoplasmic component of the soil microbial biomass) and that measurement of the total N released by CHCI, fumigation for 24 h provides a rapid method for measuring biomass N.},

  abstract = {A theory called the Regulatory Gate Hypothesis was previously proposed to considers that the rate limiting step in soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization is independent of the size, community stricture or specific activity (mg CO2-C evolved g-1 biomass C) of the soil microbial biomass. Here we report new experiments to test this hypothesis. In the first experiment, six different soils were perfused with CHCl3-saturated water to model SOC release and to stop microbial activity. Apart from one highly organic soil, they all released SOC at low and roughly constant rates, over sixty three days. In the second experiment, when the freeze-dried perfusates were returned to the parent soils, their \% mineralization ranged from 17 to 35\% over ten days, in contrast to bulk SOC (range 0.46\textendash 0.77\%). In the third experiment, two soils were given three consecutive fumigations, each followed by 10 days aerobic incubation. The microbial biomass was decreased by {$>$} 90\%, yet SOC mineralization proceeded at the same rate as in nonfumigated soil. In the fourth experiment, the six soils were subjected to various perturbations, including non-perturbed controls, fumigation-incubation, air-drying rewetting, freeze-thaw (-20~\textdegree C and~-80~\textdegree C) and sieving~{$<~$}0.3~mm. After an initial flush due to the perturbations, the rates of mineralization became roughly equal in nearly all soil treatments and comparable to the control, despite significant declines in biomass. This shows that basal respiration was little affected by the perturbations. In Experiment five the effects of the perturbations on the microbial communities in the different soils and perturbations were determined. The bacterial community was significantly modified by both fumigation and air drying-rewetting, due mainly to increased Firmiculites and decreased Proteobacteria populations. Our findings suggest that mineralization of SOC is a two-stage process: firstly, non-bioavailable forms are converted abiologically to bioavailable forms (termed the Regulatory Gate), which, only then, undergo second process, biological mineralization. This finding has serious implications for theories of e.g. SOC dynamics, effects of global warming and soil nutrient cycling.},

Our objective was to investigate the structural characteristics of hot-water extractable organic matter (HWEOM) from soils collected at various depths (S1, S2, S3) under four different vegetation types, i.e. evergreen broad-leaved forest (EBF), coniferous forest (CF), dwarf forest (DF) and alpine meadow (AM) along an elevation gradient in the Wuyi Mountains, and to relate its structural characteristics to soil properties and biological properties. Here we examine the structural characteristics of HWEOM by UV, fluorescence and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic techniques. In the synchronous fluorescence spectra of all HWEOM samples, the main emission peaks were aromatic amino acid-like fluorophores, fulvic acid-like fluorophores and polycyclic aromatic structures with a high degree of conjugation. FTIR spectroscopy showed that HWEOM featured aliphatic C-H, aromatic C=C and carbohydrate C-O functional groups. The aromaticity, the humification indices (HIXem, HIXsyn) and the fluorescence efficiency of HWEOM from the S1 layer were significantly higher in CF than those in the other three vegetation types and, in all cases they decreased with depth in the soil profile. Soil C/N ratio was highly correlated with UV absorption, humification indices and fluorescence efficiency of HWEOM. Soil metabolic quotient (qCO2) was highly negatively correlated with UV absorption and humification indices of HWEOM. The ratio of microbial biomass C to total organic C was significantly correlated with humification indices and fluorescence efficiency of HWEOM. Our results indicate that the HWEOM from CF soils contain more highly condensed aromatic and/or heterocyclic compounds and, at the same time, the high molecular weight and complex molecules are less mobile, leading to being preferentially retained in the upper soil layer. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We quantified the biodegradability in a 90 day incubation experiment by measuring the loss of hot-water extractable organic carbon (HWEOC) and calculated the sizes of labile and stable HWEOC pool and the respective decomposition rate constants by a double exponential model. We used UV and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques to characterize the structural properties of HWEOM and measured the contents of carbohydrates, phenols and hydrophilic carbon of HWEOM solution. The extent of HWEOC biodegradation was higher in EBF and DF soils with about 20\% HWEOC loss, and the labile C accounted for 13\textendash 15\% of the total HWEOC. HWEOC from CF soils was the least degradable with only 12\% HWEOC loss. The estimated mean residence time of the labile HWEOC pool was 8\textendash 10 days, whereas that of the stable HWEOC pool ranged from 3 to 6 years. The biodegradability of HWEOC increased with decreasing soil C/N ratio, aromaticity and humification indices, proportion of phenols and increasing proportion of hydrophilic carbon.},

This region is on the threshold of anticipated climate change, with glacial melt, permafrost thaw, and the melting of massive buried ice increasing liquid water availability and mobilizing soil nutrients. Experimental water and organic matter (OM) amendments were applied to investigate how these climate change effects may impact the soil communities. To identify active taxa and their functions, total community RNA transcripts were sequenced and annotated, and amended soils were compared with unamended control soils using differential abundance and expression analyses. Overall, taxonomic diversity declined with amendments of water and organic matter. The domain Bacteria increased with both amendments while Eukaryota declined from 38\% of all taxa in control soils to 8\% and 11\% in water and OM amended soils, respectively. Among bacterial phyla, Actinobacteria (59\%) dominated water-amended soils and Firmicutes (45\%) dominated OM amended soils. Three bacterial phyla (Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes) were primarily responsible for the observed positive functional responses, while eukaryotic taxa experienced the majority (27 of 34) of significant transcript losses. These results indicated that as climate changes in this region, a replacement of endemic taxa adapted to dry, oligotrophic conditions by generalist, copiotrophic taxa is likely.},

  abstract = {Over recent decades, the number of floodplain restoration projects has increased worldwide. In Switzerland, several projects have been implemented to maintain or recreate ecological functions of floodplains. Despite this, little is known about the potential of floodplain soils to release and/or accumulate carbon. In alluvial soils, carbon storage is strongly influenced by fluvial dynamics, and therefore a better understanding of carbon fluxes and stocks in such settings is clearly needed.To evaluate the impact of river restoration on carbon storage in alluvial soils, we aimed to quantify and explain carbon storage and soil organic matter (SOM) stabilisation in the uppermost soil humic layer. Three floodplains were investigated showing each of them different levels of human disturbance: a near-natural section along the Rhine River, and both restored and embanked sections along the Thur River and Emme River. Carbon storage was determined by total organic carbon (TOC) stocks. SOM stabilisation was evaluated by considering the TOC content in different granulometric fractions (1000-2000. {$\mu$}m, 500-1000. {$\mu$}m, and 250-500. {$\mu$}m) and the macro-aggregate formation, i.e. the abundance of water-stable aggregates (WSA) and the mean weight diameter of macro-aggregates (MWD).Our results show that the carbon storage and SOM stabilisation parameters were all related to soil properties such as clay, silt and total iron contents of the upper humic layer. Within each floodplain, carbon storage and SOM stabilisation parameters differed according to soil profile groups, thus reflecting a soil gradient evolution from bare alluvium soils to more stabilised soils and a hydric functioning (soils with hydromorphic features). In addition, river restoration showed various impacts on carbon storage and SOM stabilisation parameters depending on the floodplains, with a significant difference between embanked and restored sections for the Emme floodplain and no difference for the Thur floodplain. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Regression models of the regional soils database indicated that organic C increased with precipitation and clay content, and decreased with temperature. Analysis of cultivated and rangeland soils indicated that C losses due to cultivation increased with precipitation, and that relative organic C losses are lowest in clay soils. Application of the regression models to a regional climate database showed potential soil organic matter losses to be highest in the northeastern section of the Central Plains Grasslands, decreasing generally from east to west. These statistical data analyses can be combined with more mechanistic models to evaluate controls of soil organic matter formation and turnover, and the implications for regional management.},

The pulses in soil respiration, extractable C, P and N pools were quantified after a single DRW cycle (ten sampling times over 49 h). Soil was pre-incubated with or without glucose (2. 5 g kg-1) for 10 days to induce differences in the size and activity of the microflora and then either subjected to a single DRW cycle (7-day drying period) or kept constantly moist. A resin extractable P (Presin) method was used and compared to extraction of dissolved organic (DOP) and inorganic P (DIP) with a salt solution. The pulse in soil respiration, extractable organic C (EOC), Presin, DOP and DIP was immediate and greatest in the first 2 h. The Presin pulse was two to three times that measured by solution extraction (DIP). Also, Presin quantified temporal changes in P not apparent in DIP, indicating the advantage of anion-exchange membranes in quantifying short-term changes in P availability. The Presin pulse was smaller in the soil incubated with glucose showing that P pulses will be quantitatively smaller in a soil with an active microbial biomass. In contrast to P, pre-incubation with glucose did not alter EOC concentration or the pulse in EOC after rewetting.

  abstract = {Long-term cultivation of grassland soils reduces soil organic C and N content and has been associated with a deterioration in the aggregate structure of the soil. This study examined the effects of fallow (moldboard plow), stubble mulch fallow (subtill), and no-till fallow management on aggregate size distribution and aggregate organic C and N contents compared with a native (virgin) grassland soil. Aggregate size fractions were separated by wet sieving and the portion of soil was quantified for each aggregate size class. Mineral-associated ( silt and clay) organic matter was isolated by dispersing aggregates in sodium hexametaphosphate and removing the sand and particulate organic matter (POM) by passing the dispersed aggregates through a 53-mum sieve. The POM fraction is composed primarily of partially decomposed root fragments and has an average C/N ratio of about 16. A large proportion of the total soil dry weight (50-60\%) was isolated in the small macroaggregate (250-2000 mum) size class. The native grassland soil was more stable than the cultivated soils when slaked, and the no-till soil was more stable than the stubble mulch and bare fallow soil when slaked. Reduced tillage management is effective at increasing the proportion of macroaggregates and results in the accumulation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) derived POM within the aggregate structure compared with bare fallow soil. It has previously been shown that the POM fraction accounts for the majority of the soil organic matter (SOM) initially lost as a result of cultivation of grassland soils. The data reported in this study relates the loss of structural stability from cultivation to losses of organic C and N from the POM fraction.},

Molecular dimensions of components in humic SF was further achieved by diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (DOSY-NMR) based on diffusion coefficients (D), while carbon distribution was evaluated by solid state (CP/MAS) 13C NMR. Seedlings of maize and Arabidopsis were treated with different concentrations of SF to evaluate root growth. Six different SF were obtained and their carbohydrate-like content and alkyl chain length decreased with decreasing molecular size. Progressive reduction of aromatic carbon was also observed with decreasing molecular size of separated fractions. Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) spectra showed that SF were composed of complex mixtures of aliphatic, aromatic and carbohydrates constituents that could be separated on the basis of their diffusion. All SF promoted root growth in Arabidopsis and maize seedlings but the effects differed according to molecular size and plant species. In Arabidopsis seedlings, the bulk HA and its SF revealed a classical large auxin-like exogenous response, i.e.: shortened the principal root axis and induced lateral roots, while the effects in maize corresponded to low auxin-like levels, as suggested by enhanced principal axis length and induction of lateral roots. The reduction of humic heterogeneity obtained in HPSEC separated size-fractions suggested that their physiological influence on root growth and architecture was less an effect of their size than their content of specific bioactive molecules. However, these molecules may be dynamically released from humic superstructures and exert their bioactivity when weaker is the humic conformational stability as that obtained in the separated size-fractions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Soil Health refers to the ecological equilibrium and the functionality of a soil and its capacity to maintain a well balanced ecosystem with high biodiversity above and below surface, and productivity. To understand and use soil health as a tool for sustainability, physical, chemical, and biological properties must be employed to verify which respond to the soil use and manage- ment within a desired timescale. Attributes with a rapid response to natural or anthropogenic actions are considered good indicators of soil health. Among the physical indicators, soil texture, aggregation, moisture, porosity, and bulk density have been used, while among chemical indica- tors total C and N, mineral nutrients, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, among others are well established. However, most of them generally have a slow response, when compared to the biological ones, such as microbial biomass C and N, biodiversity, soil enzymes, soil respira- tion, etc., in addition to macro and mesofauna. Thus, a systemic approach based on different kinds of indicators (physical, chemical and biological) in assessing soil health would be safer than using only one kind of attribute. Many human activities have caused desertification, loss of bio- diversity, disruption of aggregates, loss of organic matter and nutrients, among others. Today, it is imperious to maintain soil health and productivity with increasing emphasis on reforestation and recuperation of degraded areas through the use of organic amendments, reintroduction of plants, soil fauna and microorganisms. This review focused on an integrative view on indicators of soil health to be used as tools for prediction of sustainability in production systems.

However, the effect of litter quality on SOM stabilization is inconsistent. High-quality litters, characterized by high N concentrations, low C/N ratios, and low phenol/lignin concentrations, are not consistently stabilized in SOM with greater efficiency than 'low-quality' litters characterized by low N concentrations, high C/N ratios, and high phenol/lignin concentrations. Here, we attempt to resolve these inconsistent results by developing a new conceptual model that links litter quality to the soil C saturation concept. Our model builds on the Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization framework (Cotrufo et~al., 2013) by suggesting the effect of litter quality on SOM stabilization is modulated by the extent of soil C saturation such that high-quality litters are not always stabilized in SOM with greater efficiency than low-quality litters.},

However, little is known about the influence of extraction temperature and duration on its biochemical composition. The effect of temperature (20 vs. 80??C) and extraction duration (1-24h) on the amounts of water-extractable organic C (WEOC), water-extractable organic N (WEON), carbohydrates, phenolics, ninhydrin-reactive organic N (NRON), and mineral N were evaluated using four agricultural soils from New Zealand and eastern Canada. More WEOC and WEON were extracted in hot than in cold water, and the same was found for all biochemical compounds tested. Biochemical components increased rapidly during the first 4h of extraction at 80??C, and at a slower rate thereafter. In contrast, at 20??C, concentrations of all measured components were at or close to their maximum after 1h and showed little change thereafter. Glucose and nitrate in the 20??C extracts both declined substantially between 1 and 24h, likely due to microbial activity. Moreover, the disappearance of glucose induced a decline in the ratio of carbohydrate-C to phenolic-C. The carbohydrates measured in water extracts at both temperatures were predominantly of microbial origin after 1h. However, the proportion of microbial carbohydrates gradually declined and the proportion of plant carbohydrates increased from 1 to 24h at 80??C. Based on these findings, we recommend limiting extractions to 1h or less at 20??C and to 4h or less at 80??C to minimize compositional changes that may occur during longer extraction periods. ?? 2014.},

To address this issue, we review recent experiments and assess whether microbial community composition is resistant, resilient, or functionally redundant in response to four different disturbances. We find that the composition of most microbial groups is sensitive and not immediately resilient to disturbance, regardless of taxonomic breadth of the group or the type of disturbance. Other studies demonstrate that changes in composition are often associated with changes in ecosystem process rates. Thus, changes in microbial communities due to disturbance may directly affect ecosystem processes. Based on these relationships, we propose a simple framework to incorporate microbial community composition into ecosystem process models. We conclude that this effort would benefit from more empirical data on the links among microbial phylogeny, physiological traits, and disturbance responses. These relationships will determine how readily microbial community composition can be used to predict the responses of ecosystem processes to global change.},

Conversion from NF to hoop pine plantations not only led to the reduction of soil total C (by 19.8\%), water-soluble organic C (WSOC) (by 17.7\%), CaCl2\textendash extractable organic C (by 38.8\%), and hot water-extractable organic C (HWEOC) (by 30.9\%) and bioavailability of soil C (as determined by CO2 evolved in the incubation), but also to a change in chemical composition of soil C with lower O-alkyl C and higher alkyl C under the 1R plantation compared with NF. Harvesting and site preparation did not significantly affect total soil C and most labile C pools (except for a decrease in WSOC), but led to a lower signal intensity in the alkyl C spectral region and a decreased alkyl C/O-alkyl C (A/O-A) ratio in the soil under the 2R compared with the 1R plantation. The shifts in the amount and nature of soil C following forest conversion may be attributed to changes in litter inputs, microbial diversity and activity, and the disturbance of soil during harvesting and site preparation.},

Electron microscopic observations of soils demonstrated that EPS are produced in soils and are closely associated with the surrounding clay particles. In the present study, experimental clay-polysaccharide associations were taken as models for the soil/biota interface, and their microstructure and physical properties were investigated. In the methodology, special attention was given to control the water potential and to preserve, as far as possible, the organizations of the original hydrated conditions. EPS increased the water retention of clay minerals or sands on desiccation and on rehydration, and reduced desiccation and rehydration rates. This was explained by the strong water-holding properties of EPS. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used, and showed that the polysaccharides occurred as a network of strands in the interparticle porosity of clay minerals. Polysaccharides changed the clay microstructure into an organo-mineral network with extensive interparticle bridging. The present results show that the clay-polysaccharide associations exhibit specific physical properties and microstructures that should affect biological functions and survival, for example through storage of water and buffering against water potential fluctuations. Clay-polysaccharide sheaths also take part in the binding of aggregates by soil biota. \textcopyright{} 1993.},

While OR quality may influence SOC and N stabilization within aggregates, the simultaneous addition of N-fertilizers may enhance OR decomposition resulting in loss of SOC. A mesocosm study was conducted on a clayey soil at Embu and a sandy soil at Machanga in central Kenya to determine the influence of soil texture, OR quality and N-fertilizer on aggregation, SOC and N. Tithonia diversifolia (high quality), Calliandra calothyrsus (medium quality) and Zea mays (maize; low quality) residues, natural abundance or labeled with 15N, were applied to soil at an equivalent rate of 4MgCha-1 compared to no input control. Each treatment was fertilized with 120kg 14N or 15Nha-1 as (NH2)2CO, or not fertilized. Soil samples were collected at installation of the mesocosms (start), and 8 months after installation (end). Soils were separated into different aggregate size fractions by wet sieving and macroaggregates were further fractionated to isolate microaggregates-within-macroaggregates. Total soil and aggregate fractions were analyzed for SOC and N. On average, 20\% and 70\% of SOC and N was in the macroaggregates in the sandy and clayey soils, respectively. There were no differences among OR quality in both soils but in the clayey soil all ORs resulted in greater SOC and N than in the control. However, proportions of OR-derived N in the macroaggregates, mostly in the microaggregates-within-macroaggregates were greater with sole applied maize in the clayey soil. The addition of N-fertilizer together with maize stover reduced soil N, macroaggregate N, and OR-derived N in the microaggregate and silt and clay fractions within macroaggregates compared to when maize was applied alone. In the sandy soil, Calliandra resulted in greater OR-derived N than Tithonia in the coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM; i.e., 5\% compared to 2\% of N applied). Thus, the greater polyphenol concentration in Calliandra likely slowed its decomposition compared to that of Tithonia. In addition, greater proportions of N and residue-derived N in the macroaggregates were observed in the coarse POM in the sandy soil whereas in the clayey soil it was in the microaggregates-within-macroaggregates. We conclude that the preservation of OR-derived N is affected by the chemical recalcitrance of the residues in sandy soils, whereas macroaggregate protection, and not OR quality, is the major factor in clayey soils. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Hot water extraction is sometimes recommended as an easy method to estimate the readily mineralizable fractions of total C (C-t) and total N (N-t) in arable soils. However, the usefulness of this method for forest soils has not been adequately studied. The objectives of this study were to relate the hot water extractable C (C-hw) and N (N-hw) to microbiological and chemical properties of the forest soils under beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stands and to test the ability of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict chemical and microbial properties of these soils. Soils differing in humus type, soil type and soil texture were collected from five locations and five depths. In all soils the amount of C-hw was higher than the microbial biomass C (C-mic) indicating that a considerable part of C-hw was of non-microbial origin. The amount of C-hw in mineral soil correlated significantly (r =-0.30-0.53) with C-mic, basal respiration (BAS) and C-t/N-t ratio but was not related to C-m! ic/C-t ratio. The amount of N-hw was correlated with C-mic, BAS, C-mic/C-t ratio, and C-t/N-t ratio (r =-0.59-0.78). However, C-t and N-t values showed better relationships (r =-0.42-0.88) with all the parameters, indicating no advantage in using C-hw and N-hw in forest soils. NIRS predicted satisfactorily C-t, N-t, C-hw, N-hw, C-mic, C-mic/C-t ratio and BAS in the mineral soils [the regression coefficients (a) of linear regression (measured against predicted values) ranged from 0.84 to 1.17 and the correlation coefficients (r) ranged from 0.86 to 0.94] indicating the applicability of NIRS to estimate these properties.},

Therefore, we determined sod C saturation in an agricultural experiment located in Ellerslie, AB, Canada, where organic-matter-rich soils have been cropped to cereal grain for 25 yr. In this experiment, the soils were subject to a broad range of soil C inputs due to a combination of straw retention, tillage, and N fertilization treatments. We determined if C saturation is occurring in soil size fractions that are functionally different. Soils were highly aggregated, with {$>$}85\% of the sods consisting of macroaggregates. Straw retention, tillage, and N fertilization had no significant effect on the SOC concentration of most soil fractions. Soil organic C concentration of whole soil and soil aggregates isolated from whole sod did not increase with greater sod C inputs. Most of the soil fractions within the large or small macroaggregates did not sequester additional SOC in response to higher soil C inputs. Conversely, SOC concentration in experimental plot soils was significantly lower than that of adjacent grassland soils, which suggests that the maximum C sequestration level for a specific soil type depends on the management practices used. We conclude that C sequestration is governed by C saturation in this highly structured and high-C soil. Our study suggests that soils of temperate ecosystems that are closer to their C saturation capacity may store additional C less effectively than soils that are further away from their saturation capacity.},

The objective of the study was to evaluate the hypothesis that soil DOC constitutes a readily-available microbial resource, and that DOC concentrations are related to rates of biological decomposition and associated nutrient release from soil organic matter. Soils from five previously cultivated old fields undergoing secondary succession and an oak savanna were selected because they had demonstrated different patterns of C and N cycling. Although amounts of total C differed dramatically (496\textendash 1371 {$\mu$}mol g-1), DOC concentrations of all soils at the time of collection were between 0.70 and 1.30 {$\mu$}mol g-1. During the incubation, total and relative DOC concentrations generally remained constant or increased while mineralization rates decreased. When all soils and incubation intervals were considered, there was no obvious relationship between DOC and instantaneous rates of mineralization. Asymptotic exponential response curves did describe positive associations between DOC and CO2-C mineralization rates at early incubation times (R2 = 0.98 for 14 and 35 days), but not later. Similar models did not show a strong relationship between DOC and net-N mineralization rates. By the end of the incubation, the DOC pool could potentially supply 1.5\textendash 3.4 days of total C mineralization, but the instantaneous C mineralization rate at any given DOC concentration was 3\textendash 10 times lower than at 14 days. These results reflect decreased DOC utilization relative to supply, and could be caused by the accumulation of recalcitrant DOC.},

Variations in soil moisture and seasonal stimulation of microbial activity are frequently cited as the major causes. The goal of this paper was to evaluate the effects of drying\textendash rewetting cycles on aggregate stability and on its main microbially mediated agents from a mechanistic point of view. The 3\textendash 5 mm aggregates of a silty soil were incubated at 20 1C for 63 days with the following treatments and their combinations: (i) with or without straw input and (ii) with or without exposure to four dry\textendash wet cycles. Microbial activity was followed by measuring the soil respiration. We estimated the microbial agents of aggregate stability measuring hot-water extractable carbohydrate-C, microbial biomass carbon and ergosterol content. We measured the water drop penetration time to estimate the hydrophobicity and aggregate stability according to Le Bissonnais [1996. Aggregate stability and assessment of soil crustability and erodibility: I. Theory and methodology. European Journal of Soil Science 47, 425\textendash 437] to distinguish three breakdown mechanisms: slaking, mechanical breakdown and microcracking. The addition of straw stimulated microbial activity and increased the resistance to the three tests of aggregate stability, enhancing the internal cohesion and hydrophobicity of aggregates. All the estimated microbial agents of aggregate stability responded positively to the addition of organic matter and were highly correlated with aggregate stability. Fungal biomass correlated better with aggregate stability than total microbial biomass did, showing the prominent role of fungi by its triple contribution: physical entanglement, production of extracellular polysaccharides and of hydrophobic substances. Dry\textendash wet cycles had less impact on aggregate stability than the addition of straw, but their effects were more pronounced when microbial activity was stimulated demonstrating a positive interaction.},

We present the current understanding of the importance of microbial substrate use efficiency and C and N allocation in controlling the proportion of plant-derived C and N that is incorporated into SOM, and of soil matrix interactions in controlling SOM stabilization. We synthesize this understanding into the Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization (MEMS) framework. This framework leads to the hypothesis that labile plant constituents are the dominant source of microbial products, relative to input rates, because they are utilized more efficiently by microbes. These microbial products of decomposition would thus become the main precursors of stable SOM by promoting aggregation and through strong chemical bonding to the mineral soil matrix.},

The pool size depends on the balance between formation of soil organic matter from decomposition of plant litter and its mineralization to inorganic carbon. Knowledge of soil organic matter formation remains limited2 and current C numerical models assume that stable soil organic matter is formed primarily from recalcitrant plant litter3. However, labile components of plant litter could also form mineral-stabilized soil organic matter4. Here we followed the decomposition of isotopically labelled above-ground litter and its incorporation into soil organic matter over three years in a grassland in Kansas,USA, and used laboratory incubations to determine the decay rates and pool structure of litter-derived organic matter. Early in decomposition, soil organic matter formed when non-structural compounds were lost from litter. Soil organic matter also formed at the end of decomposition, when both non-structural and structural compounds were lost at similar rates.We conclude that two pathways yield soil organic matter effciently. A dissolved organic matter\textendash microbial path occurs early in decomposition when litter loses mostly non-structural compounds, which are incorporated into microbial biomass at high rates, resulting in effcient soil organic matter formation. An equally effcient physical-transfer path occurs when litter fragments move into soil.},

We traced the fate of 13C-labeled necromass from 'stressed' and 'unstressed' fungi into living soil microbes, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total soil carbon and respired CO2. All stressors stimulated the production of calcium oxalate crystals and enhanced the C:N ratios of living fungal mycelia, leading to the formation of 'recalcitrant' necromass. Although we were unable to detect consistent effects of stress on the mineralization rates of fungal necromass, a greater proportion of the non-stressed (labile) fungal necromass C was stabilised in soil. Our finding is consistent with the emerging understanding that recalcitrant material is entirely decomposed within soil, but incorporated less efficiently into living microbial biomass and, ultimately, into stable SOC.},

In a group of 30 New Zealand soils, representing different management histories and parent materials, hot water extracted between 2.6 and 8.7\% of total N. The extracted N consisted mainly ({$\sim$}80\%) of organic N, with the remainder being NH4\textendash N, generated by hydrolysis of heat-labile organic N. The C/N ratio of the extracted organic matter was relatively low (mean 8:1 vs. 11:1 for total organic matter), indicating that it included N-rich substrates (i.e., substrates likely to have high mineralization potential). However, about three-quarters of the extracted organic N was relatively recalcitrant, i.e., it did not hydrolyze to ninhydrin-reactive N (NH4\textendash N, amino acid-N, amino sugar N) when treated with 1 M HCl for 6 h at 80\textdegree C.

Since OM decomposition is the opposite of OM stabilization, one might presume higher quality substrates would lead to less OM stabilization. Yet, there is growing evidence that C stabilized in the soil silt and clay fractions is preferentially derived from microbial metabolites. We hypothesized that the decomposition of higher quality substrates would increase silt and clay-sized (S)OM pools despite higher initial mineralization rates. Soils low in initial organic carbon were incubated for 139~d with substrates spanning a range of quality/lability including: (a) bermudagrass forage cut after 14d, 21d, 28d, 35d, and 42d of re-growth, and (b) ruminal digesta produced from these forages. We then monitored the production of CO2as well as the carbon abundance and isotopic composition in the bulk, silt, and clay fractions. Undigested forage was respired at higher initial rates than ruminal digesta and resulted in more carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the clay fraction. Overall, substrate quality\textemdash assessed as the ratio of neutral detergent fiber (NDF-cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) to crude protein (CP)\textemdash was directly related to decomposition kinetics with higher substrate quality resulting in more silt and clay C. These findings provide evidence that substrate quality, as a driver of microbial response, can control the flow of C and N to silt and clay fractions where there is the potential for interactions with mineral surfaces to greatly increase C and N residence times. Incorporating this concept into numerical models of SOM generation and turnover will likely improve projections of carbon dynamics in global change models.},

The soil microbiota is responsible for the recycling and mineralization of these organic amendments and their activity affects soil structure and agricultural viability. In this study we assessed the short-term effects of compost amendment on bacterial community composition and activity in agricultural soil. Changes in biomass, respiration and enzymatic activity were correlated with bacterial community profiles, as determined by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene fragments and sequencing of relevant bands. Prior to wetting, the community profile of the compost amended soils was almost identical to that of the original compost, implying that the compost bacterial content was much higher than that of the soil. Nonetheless, wetting of compost-amended soils caused an immediate shift in the bacterial community profile resulting in a pattern similar to that of the original soil profile. Initially, in the first three days following wetting, the bacterial community profiles of the control and compost-amended soils were highly similar to each other. However, from day five to day 13, significant differences in the bacterial profiles developed between the control and compost-amended soils, indicating that the compost-related effect on the bacterial community is somewhat delayed. Compost-amended soils showed enhanced rates of nitrification, respiration, hydrolytic and metabolic activities relative to the control soils without compost. They were also characterized by proliferation of communities associated with the Bacteroidetes phylum, which may be explained by the involvement of this clade in the degradation of compost-derived complex organic substrates in the soil microcosms. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Without exogenous C inputs, the temperature sensitivity of organic C mineralization (described by Q10 value) was higher in the 4.0\% SOC soil (2.31) than in the 2.9\% (1.12) and 6.8\% SOC soils (1.30). The addition of exogenous C decreased Q10 values by up to 131\% in the 4.0\% SOC soil, which was not observed in other two soils. In general, C inputs increased the Q10 of the estimated active (Ca) and stable C (Cs) pools in all the tested soils, especially the Cs pool in the 4.0 and 6.8\% SOC soils. Results indicated that the effect of C inputs on apparent organic C mineralization (either stimulatory or inhibitory) is influenced by SOC content and C source, and that temperature sensitivity of organic C mineralization in the presence of exogenous C is highly sensitive to SOC content.},

  abstract = {Permafrost soils preserve huge amounts of organic carbon (OC) prone to decomposition under changing climatic conditions. However, knowledge on the composition of soil organic matter (OM) and its transformation and vulnerability to decomposition in these soils is scarce. We determined neutral sugars and lignin-derived phenols, released by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and CuO oxidation, respectively, within plants and soil density fractions from the active layer and the upper permafrost layer at three different tundra types (shrubby grass, shrubby tussock, shrubby lichen) in the Northeast Siberian Arctic. The heavy fraction (HF; {$>$}1.6 g mL-1) was characterized by a larger enrichment of microbial sugars (hexoses vs. pentoses) and more pronounced lignin degradation (acids vs. aldehydes) as compared to the light fraction (LF; {$<$}1.6 g mL-1), showing the transformation from plant residue-dominated particulate OM to a largely microbial imprint in mineral-associated OM. In contrast to temperate and tropical soils, total neutral sugar contents and galactose plus mannose to arabinose plus xylose ratios (GM/AX) decreased in the HF with soil depth, which may indicate a process of effective recycling of microbial biomass rather than utilizing old plant materials. At the same time, lignin-derived phenols increased and the degree of oxidative decomposition of lignin decreased with soil depth, suggesting a selective preservation of lignin presumably due to anaerobiosis. As large parts of the plant-derived pentoses are incorporated in lignocelluloses and thereby protected against rapid decomposition, this might also explain the relative enrichment of pentoses with soil depth. Hence, our results show a relatively large contribution of plant-derived OM, particularly in the buried topsoil and subsoil, which is stabilized by the current soil environmental conditions but may become available to decomposers if permafrost degradation promotes soil drainage and improves the soil oxygen supply.},

Earthworm biomass, growth performance, and cocoon production were higher in vermicompost pre-pared from water hyacinth and paddy straw as compared to vermicompost prepared from sawdust. All vermibeds showed significant reduction in pH, organic carbon, cellulose content and C/N ratio and sub-stantial increase in humic acid, total N, available P and exchangeable K. Vermistabilization also increased the microbial population and enzyme activities of all organic wastes. Inoculation of A. chroococcum, B. polymixa and B. firmus alone or in combination with T. viride significantly increased nitrogen, available P and K content. Significant increases in microbial population and enzyme activities in vermicomposts were recorded with inoculation of T. viride either alone or in consortia. The best quality compost was prepared when the substrate was treated with all the four microorganisms together followed by ver-micomposting. Results indicated that the combination of earthworms and microorganisms reduced the overall time required for composting besides producing a nutrient-enriched compost product.},

  doi = {10.1038/nature04514},
  abstract = {Significantly more carbon is stored in the world's soils\textemdash including peatlands, wetlands and permafrost\textemdash than is present in the atmosphere. Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed 'apparent' temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate. T he temperature sensitivity of decomposition of the enormous global stocks of soil organic matter (SOM) 1\textendash 4 has recently received considerable interest, including several high-profile publications supporting opposing views 5\textendash 14 . Interest in this topic is high because of its importance in the global carbon (C) cycle and potential feedbacks to climate change 15 . This recent controversy has focused primarily on organic matter in upland mineral soils. These soils have reasonably good drainage and aeration, allowing roots and soil fauna to penetrate into mineral soil layers, thus mixing SOM with mineral particles. Conditions in upland mineral soils are also generally favourable for decomposition, resulting in relatively low carbon densities. In contrast, in wetlands and peatlands where anaerobic conditions frequently persist, decomposition proceeds much more slowly, and deep layers of organic matter accumulate on top of mineral layers. In soils with permanently frozen layers (permafrost), drainage is also often poor, and organic matter may become buried in deep soil layers through cryoturbation 16 . Thus, wetlands, peatlands and permafrost soils generally contain higher carbon densities than upland mineral soils, and together they make up enormous stocks of carbon globally (Table 1). Moreover, perma-frost soils and a large fraction of peatland soils occur at high latitudes, where warming is expected to be greatest, and, indeed, has already begun 17,18},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t The contribution of fungi to aggregation of soil is thought to be mediated via hyphal enmeshment of particles and increased adhesion between particles. The role of saprotrophic fungi in soil aggregation remains uncertain. This study explored the role of saprotrophic Trichocomaceae in water-stable aggre-gation of soil. Eighty-five isolates derived from agricultural and undisturbed Australian soils were identified by morphological and molecular (ITS1e5.8S rRNAeITS2) methods. The formation and stabi-lisation of soil aggregates by each isolate either through increased adhesion between particles, mediated by extracellular materials, or enmeshment during hyphal growth, and the effects of nutrition on aggregation were examined. The creation of water-stable aggregates by Trichocomaceous fungi was uncommon and largely transient, whether measured by adhesive materials alone or growth of the fungus in soil. Water-stable aggregation by adhesion was increased significantly by only one isolate. The adhesive properties of extracellular materials produced by this isolate were affected by the source of carbon. When grown in soil only six isolates increased water-stable aggregation by more than 12\% after three weeks. When grown on compost (complex carbon) selected isolates were capable of forming water-stable aggregates although these aggregates were generally not persistent. Mean weight diameter peaked after three weeks and declined thereafter with increased period of fungal growth. The potential to create water-stable aggregates by adhesion or soil enmeshment was isolate specific: the potential varied within species and was unrelated to extensive hyphal growth in culture. Saprotrophic Trichoco-maceae are capable of aggregate formation by physical enmeshment; however the aggregates formed are not stabilised beyond the short growth period of the fungi. Any increase in water-stable aggregation by Trichocomaceae as a group is likely to be transient.},

  abstract = {Microbial carbohydrates are immediate by-products of microbial metabolism and play an important role in the formation and stabilization of soil structure. The effect of long-term management on soil carbohydrate content and monosaccharide composition was investigated in five Danish sandy loams under organic and conventional management with animal manure and mineral fertilizers. Hot-water (80\textdegree C) extraction was used to measure the distribution and composition of carbohydrates in aggregate size. Carbohydrates released to hot water were determined after hydrolysis as reducing sugars equivalent to glucose. The monosaccharide composition in hot-water extracts was analyzed as the corresponding alditol acetates. Sites with a history of long-term continuos management practices were used. Three treatments from the {$>$}100 year Askov long-term field experiment were used to show results of contrasting fertilization on soil carbohydrate content. These were all grown to a four-course crop rotation. Total carbohydrate content was significantly influenced by long-term management practices, with a significantly higher carbohydrate content in soils fertilized with either mineral fertilizers or animal manure (1200 to 800 mg C kg- 1 DM aggregate) than in an unfertilized soil (600 to 500 mg C kg- 1 DM aggregate). These results were as true for micro-aggregates ({$<$}0.25 mm) as for the 0.5\textendash 1.0 mm and 4.0\textendash 8.0 mm fractions. The organically managed soil ({$>$}40 years) was sited at a commercial farm with forage crop rotations, organic manure and no use of crop protection chemicals. These results showed significantly higher levels of carbohydrate both in micro-aggregate and macro-aggregates (1200 to 900 mg C kg- 1 DM aggregate) than an adjacent conventionally managed soil with annual cash crop, mineral fertilizers and use of crop protection chemicals (960 to 760 mg C kg- 1 DM aggregate). Carbohydrate C content generally increased as aggregate size decreased in both soils. Monosaccharide distribution was generally similar among three aggregate size classes studied. In all soils the content of monosaccharide was highest in microaggregates and lowest in macro-aggregates. Mannose and galactose were normally the most common monosaccharides in the hot-water extracts of aggregate fractions, indicating a predominantly microbial origin. Full text HTML PDF},

Efficient use, however, requires an individual assessment of waste products, and effects should be compared with natural variations due to climate and soil type. An 11-month incubation experiment was conducted between April 1998 and March 1999, in which a sandy loam without or with anerobically digested sewage sludge (4.2tdrymatter(DM)ha-1) or household compost (17tDMha-1) was incubated under constant laboratory conditions at 10\textdegree C, as well as in the field. The following properties were monitored: wet-stability of soil aggregates, clay dispersibility, hot-water extractable carbohydrates, resin-extractable Pi, inorganic N, biomass C and N, PLFA profiles, FDA hydrolysis activity, {$\beta$}-glucosidase activity and CO2 evolution. In general, effects of waste amendment were positive, but moderate compared to the dynamics observed in unamended soil, and mainly occurred in the first several weeks after amendment. The temporal dynamics of inorganic N, FDA hydrolysis activity, biomass C and PLFA composition appeared to be faster under the fluctuating climatic conditions in the field. To evaluate accumulated effects of repeated waste applications, soil was also sampled from a field trial, in which the sewage sludge and household compost had been applied at the same rates as in the incubation study for three consecutive years. Sampling took place after the final harvest, i.e. 5 months after the final waste application. Compost amendment had increased potentially mineralizable N by a factor of 1.8, and sludge amendment had increased the amount of resin-extractable Pi by a factor of 1.6. However, there were no accumulated effects of waste amendment on the fraction of soil in wet-stable aggregates, or on the microbiological properties tested, which supported the observation from the incubation study that effects of organic wastes were transient.},

We followed the changes in water- and acid-extractable carbohydrate C, 14C microbial biomass and 14C microbial products and water-stable aggregation (MWD) in each aggregate size class over 56 days CO2-efflux was measured to determine mineralisation of native and glucose-derived C in each aggregate size class. Glucose amendments did not affect the MWD of the {$>$} 2 mm aggregates. Both rates of amendment increased the MWD of the {$<$} 0.25 mm aggregate size class, but only the HG treatments generally increased the MWD of the 0.5-2 mm aggregate size classes. Increases in acid- and water-extractable carbohydrate C in the amended soils, relative to non-amended soils, were generally evident only up to 7 days after amendment. After this time water-extractable carbohydrate C in the amended aggregates was generally less than that in the non-amended aggregates. The proportions of 14C accumulated in the microbial biomass increased with declining macro-aggregate size, whereas the accumulations of 14C as microbial products were generally greater in the larger macro- aggregate size classes. These differences in C turnover were poorly correlated with clay content and pore size distribution in each aggregate size class Glucose amendment initially resulted in inconsistent effects on the mineralisation of native C, however, after 21 days the HG treatments consistently increased the mineralisation of all but the 0.25-0.5 mm aggregate size class. This delayed priming effect was attributed to increased exposure of native organic C by enzyme activity in the amended soils and indicated that the amount of semi-protected mineralisable organic C increased with increasing macro-aggregate size. Despite the differences in water- extractable carbohydrate C, 14C microbial biomass and 14C microbial products between amendment treatments, generally all were poorly correlated with MWD in each treatment. This indicated that gross changes in the amounts of freshly deposited organic C did not reflect the labile organic C fractions involved in the stabilisation of aggregates in this sandy soil.},

The goal of this paper is to synthesize the catalysts of soil degradation and to highlight the interconnected nature of the social and economic causes of soil degradation. An expected three billion people will enter the middle class in the next 20 years; this will lead to an increased demand for meat, dairy products, and consequently grain. As populations rise so do the economic incentives to convert farmland to other purposes. With the intensity and frequency of droughts and flooding increasing, consumer confidence and the ability of crops to reach yield goals are also threatened. In a time of uncertainty, conservation measures are often the first to be sacrificed. In short, we are compromising our soil resources when we need them the most.},

  abstract = {Aggregate dynamics and their relationship to the microbial community have been suggested as key factors controlling SOM dynamics. Dry{$\pm$}wet (DW) cycles are thought to enhance aggregate turnover and decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), particularly in tilled soils. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of DW cycles on aggregate stability, SOM dynamics, and fungal and bacterial populations in a Weld silt loam soil (Aridic Paleustoll). Samples, taken from 250 mm sieved air-dried soil (i.e. free of macroaggregates . 250 mm), were incubated with 13C-labeled wheat residue. In one set of soil samples, fungal growth was suppressed using a fungicide (Captan) in order to discern the effect of dry{$\pm$}wet cycles on fungal and bacterial populations. Aggregate formation was followed during the \textregistered rst 14 d of incubation. After this period, one set of soil samples was subjected to four DW cycles, whereas another set, as a control, was kept at \textregistered eld capacity (FC). Over 74 d, total and wheat-derived respiration, size distribution of water stable aggregates and fungal and bacterial biomass were measured. We determined native and labeled C dynamics of three particulate organic matter (POM) fractions related to soil structure: the free light fraction (LF), and the coarse (250{$\pm$}2000 mm) and \textregistered ne (53{$\pm$}250 mm) intra-aggregate POM fraction (iPOM). In the fungicide treated soil samples, fungal growth was signi\textregistered cantly reduced and no large macroaggregates (. 2 mm) were formed, whereas without addition of fungicide, fungi represented the largest part of the microbial biomass (66\%) and 30\% of the soil dry weight was composed of large macroaggregates. During macroaggregate formation, labeled free LF-C signi\textregistered cantly decreased whereas labeled coarse iPOM-C increased, indicating that macroggregates are formed around fresh wheat residue (free LF), which is consequently incorporated and becomes coarse iPOM. The \textregistered rst drying and wetting event reduced the amount of large macroaggregates from 30 to 21\% of the total soil weight. However, macroaggregates became slake-resistant after two dry-wet cycles. Fine iPOM-C was signi\textregistered cantly lower in soil after two dry{$\pm$}wet cycles compared to soil kept at FC. We conclude that more coarse iPOM is decomposed into \textregistered ne iPOM in macroaggregates not exposed to DW cycles due to a slower macroaggregate turnover. In addition, when macroaggregates, subjected to dry{$\pm$}wet cycles, became slake-resistant (d 44) and consequently macroaggregate turnover decreased, \textregistered ne iPOM accumulated. In conclusion, differences in \textregistered ne iPOM accumulation in DW vs. control macroaggregates are attributed to differences in macroaggregate turnover. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These soils included a young, slightly weathered temperate soil dominated by 2:1 (illite and chlorite) clay minerals; a moderately weathered soil with mixed [2:1 (vermiculite) and 1:1 (kaolinite)] clay mineralogy and oxides; and a highly weathered tropical soil dominated by 1:1 (kaolinite) clay minerals and oxides. Air-dried soil was dry sieved through a 250 {$\mu$}m sieve to break up all macroaggregates and 100 g-subsamples were brought to field capacity and incubated for 42 days. After 14 and 42 days, aggregate stability was measured on field moist and air-dried soil, to determine unstable and stable aggregation respectively. In control treatments (i.e., without nutrient or organic matter addition, without roots and at constant moisture), the formation of unstable and stable macroaggregates ({$>$} 250 {$\mu$}m) increased in the order: 2:1 clay soil {$<$} mixed clay soil {$<$} 1:1 clay soil. After 42 days of incubation, nutrient addition significantly increased both unstable and stable macroaggregates in the 2:1 and 1:1 clay soils. In all soils, additional OC input increased both unstable and stable macroaggregate formation. The increase in macroaggregation with OC input was highest for the mixed clay soil and lowest for the 1:1 clay soil. In general, drying and wetting cycles had a positive effect on the formation of macroaggregates. Root growth caused a decrease in unstable macroaggregates in all soils. Larger amounts of macroaggregates were found in the mixed clay and oxides soil when plants were grown under 50\% compared to 100\% field capacity conditions. We concluded that soils dominated by variable charge clay minerals (1:1 clays and oxides) have higher potential to form stable aggregates when OC concentrations are low. With additional OC inputs, the greatest response in stable macroaggregate formation occurred in soils with mixed mineralogy, which is probably a result of different binding mechanisms occurring: i.e., electrostatic bindings between 2:1 clays, 1:1 clays and oxides (i.e. mineral-mineral bindings), in addition to OM functioning as a binding agent between 2:1 and 1:1 clays.},

  abstract = {Rhizodeposit-carbon provides a major energy source for microbial growth in the rhizosphere of grassland soils. However, little is known about the microbial communities that mediate the rhizosphere carbon dynamics, especially how their activity is influenced by changes in soil management. We combined a  13CO 2 pulse-labeling experiment with phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis in differently managed Belgian grasslands to identify the active rhizodeposit-C assimilating microbial communities in these grasslands and to evaluate their response to management practices. Experimental treatments consisted of three mineral N fertilization levels (0, 225 and 450 kg N ha -1 y -1) and two mowing frequencies (3 and 5 times y -1). Phospholipid fatty acids were extracted from surface (0-5 cm) bulk (BU) and root-adhering (RA) soil samples prior to and 24 h after pulse-labeling and were analyzed by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-c-IRMS). Soil habitats significantly differed in microbial community structure (as revealed by multivariate analysis of mol\% biomarker PLFAs) as well as in gram-positive bacterial rhizodeposit-C uptake (as revealed by greater 13C-PLFA enrichment following pulse-labeling in RA compared to BU soil in the 450N/5M treatment). Mowing frequency did not significantly alter the relative abundance (mol\%) or activity ( 13C enrichment) of microbial communities. In the non-fertilized treatment, the greatest 13C enrichment was seen in all fungal biomarker PLFAs (C16:1??5, C18:1??9, C18:2??6,9 and C18:3??3,6,9), which demonstrates a prominent contribution of fungi in the processing of new photosynthate-C in non-fertilized grassland soils. In all treatments, the lowest 13C enrichment was found in gram-positive bacterial and actinomycetes biomarker PLFAs. Fungal biomarker PLFAs had significantly lower 13C enrichment in the fertilized compared to non-fertilized treatments in BU soil (C16:1??5, C18:1??9) as well as RA soil (all fungal biomarkers). While these observations clearly indicated a negative effect of N fertilization on fungal assimilation of plant-derived C, the effect of N fertilization on fungal abundance could only be detected for the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) PLFA (C16:1??5). On the other hand, increases in the relative abundance of gram-positive bacterial PLFAs with N fertilization were found without concomitant increases in 13C enrichment following pulse-labeling. We conclude that in situ 13C pulse-labeling of PLFAs is an effective tool to detect functional changes of those microbial communities that are dominantly involved in the immediate processing of new rhizosphere-C. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {This review evaluates the importance of root exudates in determining rhizosphere bacterial community structure. We present evidence that indicates that: (1) the direct influence of root exudates on rhizosphere bacterial communities is limited to small spatiotemporal windows related to root apices; (2) upon rapid assimilation by microorganisms, root exudates are modified, independent of plant influences, before rerelease into the rhizosphere by the microorganisms themselves \textendash{} thus, at short distances from root apices, rhizosphere carbon pools are unlikely to be dominated by root exudates; and (3) many of the major compounds found in root exudates are ubiquitous in the rhizosphere as they are found in other pools of rhizodeposits and in microbial exudates. Following this argument, we suggest that the importance of root exudates in structuring rhizosphere bacterial communities needs to be considered in the context of the wider contribution of other rhizosphere carbon pools. Finally, we discuss the implications of rhizosphere bacterial distribution trends for the development of effective strategies to manage beneficial plant\textendash microorganism interactions.},

  abstract = {While dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil solution is a small but reactive fraction of soil organic matter, its source and dynamics are unclear. A laboratory incubation experiment was set up with an agricultural topsoil amended with 13C labelled maize straw. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in soil solution increased sharply from 25 to 186 mg C L\`A1 4 h after maize amendment, but rapidly decreased to 42 mg C L\`A1 and reached control values at and beyond 2 months. About 65\% of DOM was straw derived after 4 h, decreasing to 29\% after one day and only 1.3\% after 240 days. A significant priming effect of the straw on the release of autochthonous DOM was found. The DOM fractionation with DAX-8 resin revealed that 98\% of the straw derived DOM was hydrophilic in the initial pulse while this hydrophilic fraction was 20e30\% in control samples. This was in line with the specific UV absorbance of the DOM which was significantly lower in the samples amended with maize residues than in the control samples. The d13C of the respired CO2 matched that of DOC in the first day after amendment but exceeded it in following days. The straw derived C fractions in respired CO2 and in microbial biomass were similar between 57 and 240 days after amendment but were 3e10 fold above those in the DOM. This suggests that the solubilisation of C from the straw is in steady state with the DOM degradation or that part of the straw is directly mineralised without going into solution. This study shows that residue application releases a pulse of hydrophilic DOM that temporarily ({$<$}3 days) dominates the soil DOM pool and the degradable C. However, beyond that pulse the majority of DOM is derived from soil organic matter and its isotope signature differs from microbial biomass and respired C, casting doubt that the DOM pool in the soil solution is the major bioaccessible C pool in soil.},

  abstract = {It is frequently hypothesised that high soil fungal/bacterial ratios are indicative for more sustainable agricultural systems. Increased F / B ratios have been reported in extensively managed grasslands. To determine the shifts in fungal/bacterial biomass ratio as influenced by grassland management and to find relations with nitrogen leaching potential, we sampled a two-year-old field experiment at an organic experimental farm in the eastern part of The Netherlands. The effect of crop (grass and grass-clover), N application rate (0, 40, 80, 120 kg N ha- 1) and manure type (no manure, farm yard manure and slurry) on the F / B ratio within three growing seasons was tested, as well as relations with soil and crop characteristics, nitrate leaching and partial N balance. Biomass of fungi and bacteria was calculated after direct counts using epifluorescence microscopy. Fungal and bacterial biomass and the F / B ratio were higher in grass than in grass-clover. The F / B ratio decreased with increasing N application rate and multiple regression analysis revealed a negative relationship with pH. Bacterial activity (measured as incorporation of [3H]thymidine and [14C]leucine into bacterial DNA and proteins) showed the exact opposite: an increase with N application rate and pH. Leaching increased with N application rate and was higher in grass-clover than in grass. Partial N balance was more positive at a higher N application rate and showed an inverse relationship with fungal biomass and F / B ratio. We conclude that the fungal/bacterial biomass ratio quickly responded to changes in management. Grasslands with higher N input showed lower F / B ratios. Grass-clover had a smaller fungal biomass and higher N leaching than grass. In general, a higher fungal biomass indicated a lower nitrogen leaching and a more negative partial N balance (or smaller N surplus), but more observations are needed to confirm the relationship between F / B ratio and sustainability. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Structural equation modelling revealed that fungal-based soil food webs and greater microbial evenness mitigated C and N loss. Our findings show that land use strongly affects the resistance and resilience of soil food webs to climate change, and that extensively managed grassland promotes more resistant, and adaptable, fungal-based soil food webs.},

Relationships between soil biota and ecosystem processes have mostly been found in laboratory experiments and rarely are found in the field. Here, we quantified, across four countries of contrasting climatic and soil conditions in Europe, how differences in soil food web composition resulting from land use systems (intensive wheat rotation, extensive rotation, and permanent grassland) influence the functioning of soils and the ecosystem services that they deliver. Intensive wheat rotation consistently reduced the biomass of all components of the soil food web across all countries. Soil food web properties strongly and consistently predicted processes of C and N cycling across land use systems and geographic locations, and they were a better predictor of these processes than land use. Processes of carbon loss increased with soil food web properties that correlated with soil C content, such as earthworm biomass and fungal/bacterial energy channel ratio, and were greatest in permanent grassland. In contrast, processes of N cycling were explained by soil food web properties independent of land use, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacterial channel biomass. Our quantification of the contribution of soil organisms to processes of C and N cycling across land use systems and geographic locations shows that soil biota need to be included in C and N cycling models and highlights the need to map and conserve soil biodiversity across the world.},

Phosphatase and FDA enzyme activities did not depend on the crop development stages. The application of N fertilizer modified phosphatase and FDA enzyme activities, the activities being higher in soils amended with N fertilizer. The bacterial community structure was analyzed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) targeting the eubacterial 16S rRNA gene. Cluster analysis of PCR-DGGE patterns showed two major clusters, the first containing the mineral fertilization and straw treatments and the second, the straw + urea, manure and manure + urea treatments.

  abstract = {In order to study controls on metabolic processes in soils, we determined the dynamics of 13CO2 production from two position-specific 13C-labeled pyruvate isotopologues in the presence and absence of glucose, succinate, pine, and legume leaf litter, and under anaerobic conditions. We also compared 13CO2 production in soils along a semiarid substrate age gradient in Arizona. We observed that the C from the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate was lost as CO2 much faster than its other C atoms (C2,3). Addition of glucose, pine and legume leaf litter reduced the ratio between 13CO2 production from 1-13C pyruvate and 2,3-13C pyruvate (C1/C2,3 ratio), whereas anaerobic conditions increased this ratio. Young volcanic soils exhibited a lower C1/C2,3 ratio than older volcanic soils. We interpret a low C1/C2,3 ratio as an indication of increased Krebs cycle activity in response to carbon inputs, while the higher ratio implies a reduced Krebs cycle activity in response to anaerobic conditions. Succinate, a gluconeogenic substrate, reduced 13CO2 production from pyruvate to near zero, likely reflecting increased carbohydrate biosynthesis from Krebs cycle intermediates. The difference in 13CO2 production rate from pyruvate isotopologues disappeared 4-5 days after pyruvate addition, indicating that C positions were scrambled by ongoing soil microbial transformations.

  abstract = {Soil abiotic properties represent important framing conditions of ecosystems and soil microbiological biomass and microbial activity are the biological driving forces that respond sensitive to environmental impacts. In environmental research and monitoring programmes, approaches for spatial classification were elaborated poorly. Therefore, soil abiotic and microbiological indicators were clustered for a 2965 km2region in northern Italy with the aim to identify the key spatial characteristics. Forty one sampling points for 30 cm soil depth were selected at the European Grid of the Land Use Cover Area frame Statistical survey (LUCAS). Soil abiotic indicators included physical (clay content and soil bulk density) and chemical (Cd, Pb and Hg content, organic carbon and total nitrogen) properties. The values varied between 3\textendash 47 g clay 100 g-1soil, 1.27\textendash 1.62 Mg m-3, 0.69\textendash 3.47 g organic C 100 g-1soil and 0.07\textendash 0.31 g total N 100 g-1soil. Our cluster analysis with the abiotic characteristics separated two core classes derived from four clusters. In contrast, soil microbiological indicators including microbial carbon, respiration values and microbial energetic quotients, separated three well-defined core classes derived from five clusters. The microbial properties values ranged between 24\textendash 431 {$\mu$}g microbial C g-1soil and 0.08\textendash 1.82 {$\mu$}g CO2-C g-1soil h-1and corresponded to those in other European agricultural soils.

  abstract = {Priming effects (PEs) are defined as short-term changes in the turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) caused by the addition of easily degradable organic compounds to the soil. PEs are ubiquitous but the direction (acceleration or retardation of SOM decomposition) and magnitude are not easy to predict. It has been suggested that the ratio between the amount of added PE-triggering substrate to the size of initial soil microbial biomass is an important factor influencing PEs. However, this is mainly based on comparison of different studies and not on direct experimentation. The aim of the current study is to examine the impact of glucose-to-microbial biomass ratios on PEs for three different ecosystems. We did this by adding three different amounts of 13C-glucose with or without addition of mineral N (NH4NO3) to soils collected from arable lands, grasslands and forests. The addition of 13C-glucose was equivalent to 15\%, 50\% and 200\% of microbial biomass C. After one month of incubation, glucose had induced positive PEs for almost all the treatments, with differences in magnitude related to the soil origin and the amount of glucose added. For arable and forest soils, the primed C increased with increasing amount of glucose added, whereas for grassland soils this relationship was negative. We found positive correlations between glucose-derived C and primed C and the strength of these correlations was different among the three ecosystems considered. Generally, additions of mineral N next to glucose (C:N = 15:1) had little effect on the flux of substrate-derived C and primed C. Overall, our study does not support the hypothesis that the trigger-substrate to microbial biomass ratio can be an important predictor of PEs. Rather our results indicate that the amount of energy obtained from decomposing trigger substrates is an important factor for the magnitude of PEs.},

  abstract = {Microbial residues represent a significant soil organic matter pool and participate in soil aggregation. The addition of organic manure is known to modify soil aggregation and strongly influence soil microbial residues. How manure application influences the spatial distribution of microbial residues in soil aggregates is largely unknown. This study attempts to determine the effect of manure application at various rates on the content and distribution of microbial residues among aggregates of different sizes. We used a long-term manure application experiment in a Mollisol in northeastern China, where manure has been applied since 2001 at rates of 0, 7.5, 15, and 22.5Mgha-1yr-1 (dry weight). The abundance of microbial residues was indicated by amino sugar analysis. Glucosamine and muramic acid were used as biomarkers for fungal and bacterial residues, respectively. Amino sugars were examined within four aggregate fractions: large macroaggregate ({$>$}2000??m), small macroaggregate (250-2000??m), large microaggregate (53-250??m) and small microaggregate ({$<$}53??m). Application of manure at 15 and 22.5Mgha-1yr-1 provided significantly higher proportions of macroaggregates and mean weight diameter (MWD) than non-manure treatment and manure applied at 7.5Mgha-1yr-1. Manure application, especially at higher rates, significantly stimulated the accumulation of total amino sugars in both macroaggregates and large microaggregates and more amino sugars were found in {$>$}250??m macroaggregates compared with microaggregates. However, effects of manure application rates on amino sugar accumulation in larger aggregates were limited when manure rate was increased from 15 to 22.5Mgha-1yr-1. The response of fungal- and bacterial-derived amino sugars to manure application rates differed among aggregate fractions, i.e., glucosamine associated with macroaggregates increased more than that of microaggregates, whereas the enhancement of muramic acid was prominent in both macroaggregates and large microaggregates. The mass proportions of macroaggregates and MWD showed significant positive correlations with amino sugar contents, indicating that these microbial residues are involved in the formation and stabilization of aggregates. Manure applications greatly increased the contribution of microbial residues to soil organic C (SOC) in small macroaggregates and large microaggregates (P???0.05). We conclude that higher manure input may promote soil aggregation and higher SOC storage, which is closely related to a greater microbial residues-mediated improvement of soil aggregate stability. Our results also suggest that measurement of amino sugar content is a useful approach to assess fungal and bacterial contributions to soil aggregation.},

  abstract = {Soils are a key component of the terrestrial carbon cycle as they contain the majority of terrestrial carbon. Soil microorganisms mainly control the accumu-lation and loss of this carbon. However, traditional con-cepts of soil carbon stabilisation failed so far to account for environmental and energetic constraints of microorgan-isms. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that these biological limitations might have the overall control on soil carbon stability. In a long-term experiment, we incubated 13 C-labelled compost with natural soils at various soil carbon concentrations. Unexpectedly, we found that soil carbon turnover decreased with lower carbon concentra-tion. We developed a conceptual model that explained these observations. In this model, two types of particles were submitted to random walk movement in the soil profile: soil organic matter substrate and microbial decomposers. Soil carbon turnover depended only on the likelihood of a decomposer particle to meet a substrate particle; in consequence, carbon turnover decreased with lower carbon concentration, like observed in the experi-ment. This conceptual model was able to simulate realistic depth profiles of soil carbon and soil carbon age. Our results, which are simply based on the application of a two-step kinetic, unmystify the stability of soil carbon and suggest that observations like high carbon ages in subsoil, stability of carbon in fallows and priming of soil carbon might be simply explained by the probability to be decomposed.},

  abstract = {The physical, chemical, and biological soil environment for reduced or no-till farming differs greatly from that for conventional tillage. Evaluation of the soil microbial and biochemical environment greatly aids predictions of N availability to crop plants and in optimizing management practices for reduced and no-till soils. Surface soils from long-term no-till and conventional tillage plots at seven U.S. locations were characterized for microbial and biochemical components. The counts of aerobic micro-organisms, facultative anaerobes, and denitrifiers in the surface (0\textendash 7.5 cm) of no-till soils were 1.14 to 1.58, 1.57, and 7.31 times higher, respectively, than in the surface of plowed soil. Phosphatase and dehydrogenase enzyme activities and contents of water and organic C and N in the surface of no-till soil were also significantly higher than those for conventional tillage. However, at the 7.5- to 15-cm and 15- to 30-cm depths these trends were reversed and microbial populations, enzyme activities, and water and organic C and N contents were the same or higher for conventional tillage than for no-till. The trends in microbial populations with both tillage treatments were closely paralleled by soil enzyme activities and were also regulated by soil pH and levels of organic C and N. The surface 0- to 7.5-cm of no-till soil contained more potentially mineralizable N\textemdash 20 to 101 kg/ha\textemdash than did that of plowed soils. This increased labile N reserve is apparently related to the higher microbial biomass present under no-till soils. Maximum aerobic microbial activity with conventional tillage extends to a greater depth than with no-till. Microbial populations under no-till decrease rapidly below the 7.5-cm depth. At the 7.5- to 15-cm depth counts of aerobic microor-ganisms and nitrifiers were 1.32 to 1.82 times higher on the conventionally tilled soils. However, counts for facultative anaerobes and denitrifiers were 1.23 to 1.77 times higher for no-till soil. Also, the proportion of the total aerobic population represented by facultative anaerobes and denitrifiers for no-till was twice that for conventional tillage. Consequently the potential rate of mineralization and nitrification is higher with conventional tillage while that for denitrification is higher with no-till. Microbial population counts and the relative abundance of various microbial types suggests that the bochemical environment of no-till soils is less oxidative than that under conventional tillage. Changes in tillage and fertilizer management practices required for no-till soils should reflect the increased potential for immobilization of surface applied N and the lower levels of plant available NO3- as compared with those under conventional tillage.},

Anthropogenic reductions in soil health, and of individual components of soil quality, are a pressing ecological concern.Aconference entitled `Soil Health: Managing the Biological Component of Soil Quality' was held was held in the USA in November 1998 to help increase awareness of the importance and utility of soil organisms as indicators of soil quality and determinants of soil health. To evaluate sustainability of agricultural practices, assessment of soil health using various indicators of soil quality is needed. Soil organism and biotic parameters (e.g. abundance, diversity, food web structure, or community stability) meet most of the five criteria for useful indicators of soil quality. Soil organisms respond sensitively to land management practices and climate. They are well correlated with beneficial soil and ecosystem functions including water storage, decomposition and nutrient cycling, detoxification of toxicants, and suppression of noxious and pathogenic organisms. Soil organisms also illustrate the chain of cause and effect that links land management decisions to ultimate productivity and health of plants and animals. Indicators must be comprehensible and useful to land managers, who are the ultimate stewards of soil quality and soil health. Visible organisms such as earthworms, insects, and molds have historically met this criterion. Finally, indicators must be easy and inexpensive to measure, but the need for knowledge of taxonomy complicates the measurement of soil organisms. Several farmer-participatory programs for managing soil quality and health have incorporated abiotic and simple biotic indicators. The challenge for the future is to develop sustainable management systems which are the vanguard of soil health; soil quality indicators are merely a means towards this end.},

We performed complex physiological and metagenomic analyses to determine which microorganisms are the main driving agents responsible for self-purification of the mine waters and identify metabolic processes responsible for the observed features. SEM and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis showed accumulation of heavy metals on the mat surface, whereas, sorption experiments showed that neither microbial mats were completely saturated with heavy metals present in the mine waters, indicating that they have a large potential to absorb significant quantities of metal. The metagenomic analysis revealed that Methylococcaceae and Methylophilaceae families were the most abundant in both communities, moreover, it strongly suggest that backbones of both mats were formed by filamentous bacteria, such as Leptothrix, Thiothrix, and Beggiatoa. The Kowary bacterial community was enriched with the Helicobacteraceae family, whereas the Zloty Stok community consist mainly of Sphingomonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Caulobacteraceae families. Functional (culture-based) and metagenome (sequence-based) analyses showed that bacteria involved in immobilization of heavy metals, rather than those engaged in mobilization, were the main driving force within the analyzed communities. In turn, a comparison of functional genes revealed that the biofilm formation and heavy metal resistance (HMR) functions are more desirable in microorganisms engaged in water purification than the ability to utilize heavy metals in the respiratory process (oxidation-reduction). These findings provide insight on the activity of bacteria leading, from biofilm formation to self-purification, of mine waters contaminated with heavy metals.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms to mitigate global climate change by sequestering carbon (C) in different `sinks' have been proposed as at least temporary measures. Of the major global C pools, terrestrial ecosystems hold the potential to capture and store substantially increased volumes of C in soil organic matter (SOM) through changes in management that are also of benefit to the multitude of ecosystem services that soils provide. This potential can only be realized by determining the amount of SOM stored in soils now, with subsequent quantification of how this is affected by management strate- gies intended to increase SOM concentrations, and used in soil C models for the prediction of the roles of soils in future climate change. An apparently obvious method to increase C stocks in soils is to augment the soil C pools with the longest mean residence times (MRT). Computer simulation models of soil C dynamics, e.g. RothC and Century, partition these refractory constituents into slow and passive pools with MRTs of centuries to millennia. This partition- ing is assumed to reflect: (i) the average biomolecular properties of SOM in the pools with reference to their source in plant litter, (ii) the accessibility of the SOM to decomposer organisms or catalytic enzymes, or (iii) constraints imposed on decomposition by environmental conditions, including soil moisture and temperature. However, con- temporary analytical approaches suggest that the chemical composition of these pools is not necessarily predictable because, despite considerable progress with understanding decomposition processes and the role of decomposer organisms, along with refinements in simulation models, little progress has been made in reconciling biochemical properties with the kinetically defined pools. In this review, we will explore how advances in quantitative analytical techniques have redefined the new understanding of SOM dynamics and how this is affecting the development and application of new modelling approaches to soil C},

  abstract = {Soil food webs cycle nutrients and regulate parasites and pathogens, services essential for both agricultural productivity and ecosystem health. Nematodes provide useful indicators of soil food web dynamics. This study was conducted to determine if nematode soil food web indicators and crop yield can be enhanced by combinations of cover crops in a conservation tillage system. The effects of three cover crop treatments (vetch/pea, oat/wheat and oat/wheat/pea/vetch) with low, medium and high C:N and a bare fallow control were investigated in Davis, CA. Nematode fauna, soil properties and plant productivity were measured. Soil food web indices, including the Enrichment Index (EI), Structure Index (SI), Basal Index (BI), and Channel Index (CI), based on the composition of nematode assemblages, were calculated to infer soil food web condition. Cover cropped tomato/corn rotations had twice the number of enrichment opportunist bacterial feeding nematodes, active participants in nitrogen mineralization, than fallowed tomato/corn rotations (opportunist bacterial feeders = 163 versus 98). In winter fallowed plots food webs were basal, common in disturbed, nutrient-poor conditions (BI = 37). Total number of enrichment opportunist nematodes, soil NH4-N levels, and inferred nitrogen mineralization, were higher in cover crop treatments with low to mid C:N ratios. Omnivore and predator nematodes were scarce, averaging less than 6 nematodes 100 g-1in all treatments. In year one, plant productivity was highest after fallow. In contrast, in year two productivity was highest after cover crops with high nitrogen content and productivity significantly correlated with the structure of the soil fauna. Monitoring the abundance of enrichment opportunists may provide managers with a new tool to evaluate soil food web nitrogen mineralization and plant productivity. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {We evaluated arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) species diversity and abundance in nine locations along an anthropogenic nitrogen deposition gradient in coastal sage scrub (CSS) vegetation in southern California. The primary pollutants were nitrogen oxides derived from vehicular emissions. Extractable soil N on the gradient ranged from 5 to 87 ␮g/ g during the summer months. For comparative purposes, we also assessed AM communities in nitrogen-fertilized (60 kg N{$\cdot$}haϪ1{$\cdot$}yrϪ1) and unfertilized plots. Nitrogen enrichment induced a shift in AM community composition. In particular, an increasing input of nitrogen was associated with the displacement of the larger-spored species of Scutellospora and Gigaspora (due to a failure to sporulate) with a concomitant proliferation of small-spored Glomus species (e.g., Glomus aggregatum, Glomus leptotichum). A subsequent reduction in species richness and diversity (as measured by Shannon\textendash Wiener index) accompanied eutrophication. Nitrogen enrichment also significantly reduced spore abundance, modified the timing of AM spore production in the most eutrophied site, and reduced hyphal and vesicular root infection. The fertilization experiment yielded similar patterns to those found along the gradient, and hence nitrogen input most likely explains the relationship between anthropogenic pollution and shifts in the AM communities. Such changes also indicated that AM species were sensitive indicators of nitrogen enrichment. The CSS is currently undergoing a conversion to Mediterranean annual grasslands, especially in the more urban polluted areas, and the shifts in the mycorrhizal fungal community may facilitate grass dominance in this system.},

The impact of the different initial C/N ratios (11, 35, 47, 50, and 54) on the composting process and the end product was evaluated by examining chemical and microbiological parameters during 12 months of composting. Low initial C/N ratios caused a fast degradation of fibers during the first three months of composting (hemicellulose: 50-80\%, cellulose: 40-60\%), while high initial C/N ratios resulted in 10-20\% degradation of both hemicellulose and cellulose. These differences were reflected in the microbial biomass and respiration, which initially were higher in low C/N treatments than in high C/N treatments. After 12 months of composting, this situation was reversed. Composts with high initial C/N ratios had high microbial biomass (15-20 mg ATP g-1 OM) and respiration rates (200 mg CO2 h-1 g-1 OM) compared to treatments with low initial C/N ratios (less than 10 mg ATP g-1 OM and 25 mg CO2 h-1 g-1 OM). This could be explained by the microorganisms being nitrogen limited in the high C/N ratio treatments. In the low C/N ratio treatments, without nitrogen limitation, the high activity in the beginning decreased with time because of exhaustion of easily available carbon. Different nitrogen availability was also seen in the nitrification patterns, since nitrate was only measured in significant amounts in the treatments with initial C/N ratios of 11 and 35. The microbial community structure (measured as phospholipid fatty acid, PLFA, profile) was also affected by the initial C/N ratios, with lower fungal/bacterial ratios in the low compared to the high C/N treatments after 12 months of composting. However, in the low C/N treatments higher levels of PLFAs indicative of thermophilic gram-positive bacteria were found compared to the high C/N treatments. This was caused by the initial heating phase being longer in the low than in the high C/N treatments. The different fungal/bacterial ratios could also be explained by the initial heating phase, since a significant correlation between this ratio and heat generated during the initial composting phase was found.},

  abstract = {We review recent experimental results on the role of soil biota in stabilizing or destabilizing soil organic matter (SOM). Specifically, we analyze how the differential substrate utilization of the various decomposer organisms contributes to a decorrelation of chemical stability, residence time, and carbon (C) age of organic substrates. Along soil depth profiles, a mismatch of C allocation and abundance of decomposer organisms is consistently observed, revealing that a relevant proportion of soil C is not subjected to efficient decomposition. Results from recent field and laboratory experiments suggest that (1) bacterial utilization of labile carbon compounds is limited by short-distance transport processes and, therefore, can take place deep in the soil under conditions of effective local diffusion or convection. In contrast, (2) fungal utilization of phenolic substrates, including lignin, appears to be restricted to the upper soil layer due to the requirement for oxygen of the enzymatic reaction involved. (3) Carbon of any age is utilized by soil microorganisms, and microbial C is recycled in the microbial food web. Due to stoichiometric requirements of their metabolism, (4) soil animals tend to reduce the C concentration of SOM disproportionally, until it reaches a threshold level. The reviewed investigations provide new and quantitative evidence that different soil C pools underlie divergent biological constraints of decomposition. The specialization of decomposers towards different substrates and microhabitats leads to a relatively longer persistence of virtually all kinds of organic substrates in the nonpreferred soil spaces. We therefore propose to direct future research explicitly towards such biologically nonpreferred areas where decomposition rates are slow, or where decomposition is frequently interrupted, in order to assess the potential for long-term preservation of C in the soil.},

Habitable pore space and microbial trophic interactions. -Oikos 35: 327-335. Microbial trophic structure and available soil pore space influence rates of decom-position and mineralization. The nematode (Mesodiplogaster) used feeds on bacteria (Pseudomonas) as well as amoebae (Acanthamoeba) but grows best in the presence of amoebae. Respiration rates were higher when both grazers were grown with bacteria (food web) than when grazers were grown singly with bacteria (simple food chain). We hypothesized that one reason for increased nematode growth in the presence of amoebae is that protozoa make food more available to nematodes by entering soil pores inaccessible to nematodes, feeding on bacteria within the pores, and emerging as food otherwise unavailable to nematodes. To test this possibility, we designed an experiment using a fine-textured (with fewer habitable pores for nematodes) and a coarse-textured soil. There was a greater proportional increase in nematode growth with amoebae in the fine than in the coarse soil. We conclude that microbial trophic structure in relation to soil texture and habitable pore space is an important factor influencing energy flow in terrestrial ecosystems.},

Aggregate size distributions observed for our soils are very similar to those of Australian soils, indicating that the microaggregate-macroaggregate model may hold for a wide array of grassland soils from around the world. The use of two wetting treatments prior to sieving demonstrated that the native sod soil had the same general structural characteristics as cultivated soil but the macroaggregates were more stable. When slaked, native and cultivated soil present in the microaggregate size classes had less organic C, N, and P than the soil remaining as macroaggregates, even when expressed on a sand-free basis. Moreover, the C/N, C/P, and N/P ratios of microaggregates were narrower than those of macroaggregate size classes. Much more C and N was lost than P under the conditions of this study. Element-specific differences in microbial catabolic processes vs. extracellular enzyme activity and its attendant feedback controls are postulated to account for this difference. When the macroaggregates were crushed to the size of microaggregates, mineralizable C as a percent of the total organic C was generally greater for macro- than microaggregates early in the incubation for the cultivated soil and throughoutmost of the incubation for the native sod soil. Mineralizable N as a percent of the total organic N was greatest in macroaggregates even when the macroaggregates were not crushed. The macroaggregate-micraggregate conceptual model is applied to help explain accumulation of soil organic matter under native conditions and its loss upon cultivation.},

Topsoil samples were collected from four arable sandy loam soils found as two pairs (FP1 and FP2) of neighbouring fields. One of the fields in FP2 had been grown for decades with annual cash crops without application of organic manures, while the other three fields had been managed with diversified crop rotations and manure dressings. Aggregates were segregated from the bulk soil by promoting brittle failure. The samples of soil structural units were fractionated to 4-8~mm, 0.5-1~mm and 0.063-0.25~mm aggregates during a process of air-drying with minimum energy input (e.g. short sieving times). We measured microbial biomass, ergosterol, clay dispersibility, hot-water extractable carbohydrates, and hyphal length. Generally, all four soils showed no significant differences among aggregate size classes in the content of microbial biomass, hot-water extractable carbohydrates and hyphal length. The FP2 soil grown with annual cash crops had significantly lower values for all soil attributes than its neighbouring soil, while a more complex pattern was observed for the FP1 soils. Our results do not indicate scaling according to aggregate size of the binding and bonding mechanisms studied. Results from the three fields with diversified crop rotations indicate satisfactory levels of bonding and binding agents for creation of stable aggregates. Exhaustion of soil organic matter as found in the cash crop system seems to change the way that clay particles interact with the biotic agents in aggregation. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Micromorphology observations showed macropores from very fine to coarse size and numerous mesopores were heterogeneously distributed in the soil matrix and concentrations of OM of increasing stages of decomposition within and around the macroporosity. CT images easily detected coarse-sized OM concentrations and recovered part of the discontinuous pattern of the coarse-sized OM fragments in the macroporosity. We defined a table of correspondence between the structural features (porosity) and organo-mineral features of size down to about 40. ??m and the grey level values of the scanned image. The values of the thresholds were adjusted from the micromorphological observations and the porosities of the 3D segmented images compared well with the measured porosity of the third soil column.

Living fungal tissue was additionally determined by the cell-membrane component ergosterol. The organic amendments were fibrous maize cellulose and sugarcane sucrose adjusted to the same C/N ratio of 15. In a subsequent step, spherical cellulose was added without N to determine whether the microbial residues formed initially were preferentially decomposed. In the non-amended control treatment, ergosterol remained constant at 0.44 ??g g-1 soil throughout the 67-day incubation. It increased to a highest value of 1.9 ??g g-1 soil at day 5 in the sucrose treatment and to 5.0 ??g g-1 soil at day 33 in the fibrous cellulose treatment. Then, the ergosterol content declined again. The addition of spherical cellulose had no further significant effects on the ergosterol content in these two treatments. The non-amended control treatment contained 48 ??g muramic acid and 650 ??g glucosamine g-1 soil at day 5. During incubation, these contents decreased by 17\% and 19\%, respectively. A 33\% increase in muramic acid and an 8\% increase in glucosamine were observed after adding sucrose. Consequently, the ratio of fungal C to bacterial C based on bacterial muramic acid and fungal glucosamine was lowered in comparison with the other two treatments. No effect on the two amino sugars was observed after adding cellulose initially or subsequently during the second incubation period. This indicates that the differences in quality between sucrose and cellulose had a strong impact on the formation of microbial residues. However, the amino sugars did not indicate a preferential decomposition of microbial residues as N sources. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The objective of this study was to determine whether a functional relationship exists between the PSDs obtained by the combined sieve-pipette method and those obtained by LD. Samples from 42 California soils were analyzed. For the LD measurements a BeckmanCoulter LS-230 apparatus with a 750-nm laser beam that measures particles in the range of 0.04 to 2000 {$\mu$}m was used, employing the Mie theory for the PSD calculations. Values of 1.5 and 0.2 for the real part and the imaginary term of the refractive index (RI), respectively, gave satisfactory results for the optical model calculations. Volume percentage of the clay-size fraction obtained by LD was generally lower than mass percentage of the clay fraction derived by the pipette method. The opposite trend was noted for the silt-size fraction. Coefficients of determination for the regression equations for the clay, silt, and sand fractions determined by the two methods were 0.702, 0.689, and 0.821, respectively. Good agreement between measured and calculated LD values for one size class was accompanied by poor agreement between measured and calculated values for the other.

  abstract = {Stoichiometric homeostasis of heterotrophs is a common, but not always well-examined premise in ecological stoichiometry. We experimentally evaluated the relationship between substrate (plant litter) and consumer (microorganisms) stoichiometry for a tropical terrestrial decomposer system. Variation in microbial C~:~P and N~:~P ratios tracked that of the soluble litter fraction, but not that of bulk leaf litter material. Microbial N and P were not isometrically related, suggesting higher rates of P than N sequestration in microbial biomass. Shifts in microbial stoichiometry were related to changes in microbial community structure. Our results indicate that P in dissolved form is a major driver of terrestrial microbial stoichiometry, similar to aquatic environments. The demonstrated relative plasticity in microbial C~:~P and N~:~P and the critical role of P have important implications for theoretical modelling and contribute to a process-based understanding of stoichiometric relationships and the flow of elements across trophic levels in decomposer systems.},

To assess the bias of a commonly used soil DNA extraction kit, we varied the cell lysis protocol and conducted multiple extractions on subsamples of clay, sand, and organic soils. DNA, as well as bacterial and fungal ribosomal gene copies as measured by quantitative PCR, continued to be isolated in successive extractions. When terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism was used, a significant shift in community composition due to extraction bias was detected for bacteria but not for fungi. Pyrosequencing indicated that the relative abundances of sequences from rarely cultivated groups such as Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonades, and Verrucomicrobia were higher in the first extraction than in the sixth but that the reverse was true for Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. This suggests that the well-known phylum-level bacterial cultivation bias may be partially exaggerated by DNA extraction bias. We conclude that bias can be adequately reduced in many situations by pooling three successive extractions, and additional measures should be considered when divergent soil types are compared or when comprehensive community analysis is necessary.

Determining the effects of biochar additions on CO2 emissions from semi-arid soils is therefore essential for evaluating the potential of biochar as a climate change mitigation strategy. Here, we measured the CO2 that evolved from semi-arid calcareous soils amended with biochar at rates of 0 and 20 t ha-1 in a full factorial combination with three different fertilizers (mineral fertilizer, municipal solid waste compost, and sewage sludge) applied at four rates (equivalent to 0, 75, 150, and 225 kg potentially available N ha-1) during 182 days of aerobic incubation. A double exponential model, which describes cumulative CO2 emissions from two active soil C compartments with different turnover rates (one relatively stable and the other more labile), was found to fit very well all the experimental datasets. In general, the organic fertilizers increased the size and decomposition rate of the stable and labile soil C pools. In contrast, biochar addition had no effects on any of the double exponential model parameters and did not interact with the effects ascribed to the type and rate of fertilizer. After 182 days of incubation, soil organic and microbial biomass C contents tended to increase with increasing the application rates of organic fertilizer, especially of compost, whereas increasing the rate of mineral fertilizer tended to suppress microbial biomass. Biochar was found to increase both organic and inorganic C contents in soil and not to interact with the effects of type and rate of fertilizer on C fractions. As a whole, our results suggest that the use of biochar as enhancer of semi-arid soils, either alone or combined with mineral and organic fertilizers, is unlikely to increase abiotic and biotic soil CO2 emissions.},

Materials were either placed on the soil surface or incorporated. Unamended and mineral fertilizer control plots were established. Plots were maintained vegetation-free so that the food web activity was fueled by resident soil organic matter and the input material. Enrichment-opportunist bacterivore nematodes increased rapidly in response to low C/N plant materials and, to a lesser extent, to more complex materials. General-opportunist bacterivores increased in all plots, but at a slower rate. Fungivore nematodes also increased gradually in all plots but most rapidly in those amended with higher C/N and more complex materials. Indices derived from nematode faunal analysis suggested a constant rate of succession from enrichment-opportunist to general-opportunist bacterivore guilds across all treatments, probably mediated by bacterial abundance and differences in life course characteristics of the respective taxa. The rate of succession from bacterivore to fungivore nematodes was greatest in plots receiving high C/N materials. Succession to fungivory, presumably indicating a shift from bacterial to fungal decomposition channels, was slowest in those plots with a high level of organismal metabolic activity, as measured by soil respiration. The cumulative amounts of N mineralized in the plots were directly related to the enrichment index (EI), based on the abundance of opportunistic bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes. The amounts of mineralized N were inversely related to the slope of the channel index (CI), that is, the rate at which decomposition changed from bacterial to fungal. Maintenance of adequate soil fertility in systems driven by organic input may require maintenance of food web structure and function as indicated by high levels of enrichment-opportunist bacterivore nematodes. That will require frequent supply of labile organic sources. Allowing food web succession to guilds that indicate lower mineralization potential will result in lower levels of soil fertility. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The food web was manipulated by irrigating the dry soil of late summer and/or providing carbon sources. By creating conditions conducive for biological activity, we increased the abundance of bacterivore and fungivore nematodes in the fall and the following spring. Greater biological activity in the soil enhanced concentrations of mineral N available to the subsequent summer tomato crop. Mineral N concentration in the spring was associated with abundance of bacterivore nematodes, and with the corresponding Enrichment Index (EI) provided by nematode community analysis. Because environmental conditions that favour increase of bacterivore nematodes probably also favour other microbial grazers, including protozoa, the abundance of bacterivore nematodes may be an indicator of overall grazing activity and N mineralisation rates from soil fauna. Decomposition pathways in the spring, inferred from nematode bioindicators, were dominated by bacteria in plots that had been irrigated the previous fall while fungi were more prevalent in those that had not. The responses of omnivore and predator nematodes to our treatments were not consistent and there was no evidence that regulation of opportunist species by predators would be enhanced by the management practices imposed. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Treatment variables included cover crop mixtures and compost application rates. The abundances of bacterivore and fungivore nematodes were enhanced by the annual use of winter cover crops but showed no relationship to the level of residual soil organic matter. Metabolic footprints, based on biomass and respiratory activity, were calculated for functional guilds and ecosystem services of the nematode assemblage. The enrichment footprint, representing the ecosystem service of nutrient mineralization, was related to the level of soil organic carbon. It was strongly related to the metabolic footprint of bacterivore nematodes and both were enhanced in treatments that were cover cropped annually. Cover-cropped treatments also had a slightly higher herbivore footprint, suggesting support of some taxa of plant-feeding nematodes. The structure footprint, reflecting the metabolic activity of higher trophic level nematodes, including the predators of opportunistic species, did not differ among cover crop and compost amendment treatments. However, enrichment footprints were correlated with bacterivore footprints, which represented the predominantly bacterivore resources available to predators. Abundance of predators increased as a function of the abundance of those nematode prey that can be amplified by organic inputs. The functional connectance, represented by spatial co-location, between predators and amplifiable prey was greater in treatments with a greater abundance of predators. The functional connectance between predators and herbivore prey, representing a management target, was strongly related to the functional connectance between predators and amplifiable prey. We conclude that cover crops not only affect organisms at the entry level of the web but that resources are also transferred to higher trophic links which increases top-down pressure on plant-parasitic nematodes. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The soil provides a great variety of microhabitats for myriad organisms of different size, physiological activity, behavior and ecosystem function. Besides abundance of participating soil organisms, their species diversity facilitates maximum exploitation of the resources available in the different habitats. At various levels of resolution, species can be categorized into classes performing ecosystem functions and, within each functional class, into guilds of species with similar life course characteristics. Measurement of the diversity and abundance of species within a functional class provides insights into the nature of ecosystem functions and services and to the health of the soil. At higher resolution, species diversity within guilds of a functional class may infer the degree of exploitation of available resources and the complementarity of an ecosystem service; diversity among the guilds of a functional class may indicate successional complementarity of the services. A diversity of guilds within a functional class expands the range of conditions over which ecosystem services are performed while species diversity within a functional class and its guilds contributes to the magnitude of the services. Consequently, diversity of species within functional classes is a key element of the biological component of soil health. In the context of ecosystem services and soil health, the biomass or metabolic activity of species are more useful measures of their abundance than numbers of individuals. Thus, understanding of soil health and ecosystem function requires, besides knowledge of species diversity within functional classes, assessment of the range of functions currently performed in the system and the abundances of organisms by which they are performed. We propose a diversity-weighted abundance product for comparison of the functional magnitude of different assemblages of like organisms.},

  abstract = {The rapid rewetting of a dry soil often yields a pulse in soil CO2 production that persists for 2 to 6 d. This phenomenon is a common occurrence in surface soils, yet the mechanism responsible for producing the CO2 pulse has not been positively identified. We studied the effects of a single drying and rewetting event on soil C pools, to identify which specific C substrates are mineralized to produce the observed pulse in respiration rates. We labeled two soils with 14C-glucose and measured the enrichment and pool sizes of the released CO2, extractable biomass C, and extractable soil organic matter (SOM-C) throughout a drying and rewetting cycle. After rewetting, respiration rates were 475 to 370\% higher than the rates measured before the dry down. The enrichment of the released CO2 was 1 to 2 times higher than the enrichment of the extractable biomass C pools and 10 to 20 times higher than the enrichment of the extractable organic C, suggesting that the CO2 pulse was generated entirely from the mineralization of microbial biomass C. However, there was no evidence of substantial microbial cell lysis on rewetting. We hypothesize that the pulse of CO2 is generated by the rapid mineralization of highly enriched intracellular compounds as a response by the microbial biomass to the rapid increase in soil water potentials. The drying and rewetting process also releases physically protected SOM, increasing the amount of extractable SOM-C by up to 200\%. The additional SOM-C rendered soluble by the rewetting event did not contribute substantially to the rewetting CO2 pulse. Overall, the rapid rewetting of a dry soil can influence soil C cycling in the short-term, by increasing the microbial mineralization of cytoplasmic solutes, and in the longerterm, by decreasing the total amount of SOM physically protected within microaggregates.},

  abstract = {Low bioavailability of organic carbon (C) and energy are key constraints to microbial biomass and activity. Microbial biomass, biodiversity and activity are all involved in regulating soil ecosystem services such as plant productivity, nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emissions. A number of agricultural practices, of which tillage and fertiliser application are two examples, can increase the availability of soil organic C (SOC). Such practices often lead to reductions in soil aggregation and increases in SOC loss and greenhouse gas emissions. This review focuses on how the bioavailability of SOC and energy influence the ecology and functioning of microorganisms in agricultural soils. Firstly we consider how management practices affect the bioavailability of SOC and energy at the ecosystem level. Secondly we consider the interaction between SOC bioavailability and ecological principles that shape microbial community composition and function in agricultural systems. Lastly, we discuss and compare several examples of physiological differences that underlie how microbial species respond to C availability and management practices. We present evidence whereby management practices that increase the bioavailability of SOC alter community structure and function to favour microbial species likely to be associated with increased rates of SOC loss compared to natural ecosystems. We argue that efforts to restore stabilised, sequestered SOC stocks and improve ecosystem services in agricultural systems should be directed toward the manipulation of the microbial community composition and function to favour species associated with reduced rates of SOC loss. We conclude with several suggestions regarding where improvements in multi-disciplinary approaches concerning soil microbiology can be made to improve the sustainability of agricultural systems.},

Despite their importance, it remains unknown how the competition between microbial uptake and sorption to the soil matrix affects the LMWOS turnover in soil solution. This study describes the dynamics of LMWOS fluxes (10 \textmu m) in various pools (dissolved, sorbed, decomposed to CO2 and incorporated into microbial biomass) and also assesses the LMWOS distribution in these pools over a very wide concentration range (0.01\textendash 1000 \textmu m). Representatives of each LMWOS group (glucose for sugars, alanine for amino acids, acetate for carboxylates), uniformly 14C-labelled, were added to sterilized or non-sterilized soil and analysed in different pools between 1 minute and 5.6 hours after addition. LMWOS were almost completely taken up by microorganisms within the first 30 minutes. Surprisingly, microbial uptake was much faster than the physicochemical sorption (estimated in sterilized soil), which needed 60 minutes to reach quasi-equilibrium for alanine and about 400 minutes for glucose. Only acetate sorption was instantaneous. At a concentration of 100 \textmu m, microbial decomposition after 4.5 hours was greater for alanine (76.7 {$\pm$} 1.1\%) than for acetate (55.2 {$\pm$} 0.9\%) or glucose (28.5 {$\pm$} 1.5\%). In contrast, incorporation into microbial biomass was greater for glucose (59.8 {$\pm$} 1.2\%) than for acetate (23.4 {$\pm$} 5.9\%) or alanine (5.2 {$\pm$} 2.8\%). Between 10 and 500 \textmu m, the pathways of the three LMWOS changed: at 500 \textmu m, alanine and acetate were less mineralized and more was incorporated into microbial biomass than at 10 \textmu m, while glucose incorporation decreased. Despite the fact that the LMWOS concentrations in soil solution were important for competition between sorption and microbial uptake, their fate in soil is mainly determined by microbial uptake and further microbial transformations. For these substances, which represent the three main groups of LMWOS in soil, the microbial uptake out-competes sorption.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that the low quality of soil carbon limits the amount of energy available for soil microorganisms, and in turn the rate of soil carbon mineralization. The priming effect, i.e. the increase in soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition rate after fresh organic matter input to soil, is often supposed to result from a global increase in microbial activity due to the higher availability of energy released from the decomposition of fresh organic matter. Work to date, however, suggests that supply of available energy induces no effect on SOM mineralization. The mechanisms of the priming effect are much more complex than commonly believed. The objective of this review was to build a conceptual model of the priming effect based on the contradictory results available in the literature adopting the concept of nutritional competition. After fresh organic matter input to soils, many specialized microorganisms grow quickly and only decompose the fresh organic matter. We postulated that the priming effect results from the competition for energy and nutrient acquisition between the microorganisms specialized in the decomposition of fresh organic matter and those feeding on polymerised SOM. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Little is known, however, about the factors controlling the stability of soil organic carbon stocks and the response of the soil carbon pool to climate change remains uncertain. We investigated the stability of carbon in deep soil layers in one soil profile by combining physical and chemical characterization of organic carbon, soil incubations and radiocarbon dating. Here we show that the supply of fresh plant-derived carbon to the subsoil (0.6-0.8 m depth) stimulated the microbial mineralization of 2,567 +/- 226-year-old carbon. Our results support the previously suggested idea that in the absence of fresh organic carbon, an essential source of energy for soil microbes, the stability of organic carbon in deep soil layers is maintained. We propose that a lack of supply of fresh carbon may prevent the decomposition of the organic carbon pool in deep soil layers in response to future changes in temperature. Any change in land use and agricultural practice that increases the distribution of fresh carbon along the soil profile could however stimulate the loss of ancient buried carbon.},

Additionally, few studies have addressed the effects of specific pornography characteristics. Past research has shown that male-centric pornography can be related to negative outcomes, while female-centric pornography is related to more positive outcomes, particularly in women. The present survey study examined the relationship between pornography characteristics (male- and female-centric) and the self-reported attitudes and sexual experiences of men and women. Participants in the full sample were 195 men and 310 women who completed an online questionnaire. Although effect sizes were small, women who reported viewing pornography with more female-centric features also reported more positive effects of pornography on sex life and perceptions of the other gender. While men were more likely than women to report negative effects relating to pornography use on these same measures, there were very few reported negative effects of pornography overall. These findings demonstrate a small association between the use of female-centric pornography and more positive outcomes, particularly for women.},

  abstract = {This study illustrated how crop residue-derived carbon interacts with non-residue carbon (e.g., native soil carbon) in agroecosystems and how carbon is allocated to soil organisms and respiration under different tillage regimes. The carbon dynamics in crop residue, soil microorganisms, nematodes and respiration were monitored using 14C-labeled corn residue. In addition, the carbon budget was estimated for both conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) agricultural ecosystems during the short period after residue application. A laboratory and a field study were conducted separately to assess the above objectives. The results illustrated that the general patterns of carbon allocation were similar in both laboratory and field studies but at a lower magnitude in the field. Most 14C input to soil was released into air through soil respiration (93-98\%) under both CT and NT regimes, with only a small portion bound in microbial (1.8-6.5\%) and nematode biomass (0.01-0.12\%). However, more 14C was retained in microbial and nematode biomass under CT than under NT, while the 14C distributed in soil respiration was similar under both tillage regimes. The 14C specific activities of soil microorganisms, nematodes and respiration were significantly higher under CT than under NT. The higher 14C specific activities of soil microorganisms and nematodes, and more 14C retained in the biomass of soil microorganisms and nematodes under CT, suggested that soil organisms might use C more efficiently under CT than under NT. During the short-term experiments, cumulative soil respiration was significantly higher but residue-derived carbon contributed less to soil respiration under NT than under CT. Consequently, more non-residue carbon (e.g., native soil carbon) was decomposed and respired by soil organisms under NT than under CT after 40 days of the residue application. It is suggested that residue application might cause a net loss of soil carbon in agroecosystems possibly because of the priming effect of crop residue, particularly under NT regime under the short term.

The effects of these applications on soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass at crop harvest were measured after nine years. In comparison with the control (no amendment) MSW addition increased biomass C by 10 and 46\% at application rates of 20 and 80 t haϪ1, respectively, while MA treatment increased microbial biomass C by 29\%. The ratio of soil microbial C to soil organic C was the lowest at the high rate of MSW application. Oxidoreductase enzymes, such as dehydrogenase and catalase, were higher in the MSW treatments by 730 (C20) and 200\% (C80), respectively, and by 993 and 140\% in MA treatments than in the unamended soil, indicating an increase in the microbial metabolism in the soil as a result of the mineralization of biodegradable C fractions contained in the amendments. The addition of MSW and MA caused different responses in hydrolase enzymes. Phosphatase activity decreased with MSW (\^62\% at both rates) and MA (\^73\%), to less than those in the mineral fertilization and the control treatments. Urease activity decreased by 21\% (C20) and 28\% (C80), possibly being affected by the heavy metals contained in the MSW. However, b-glucosidase and protease-BAA increased in all the organic treatments, especially with MA (by 214 and 177\%, respectively). This is attributed to the microbial stimulation by the organic C and is correlated with the increase in dehydrogenase r2  0:882 and catalase r2  0:654 activities. ᭧ 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The management practices assayed were as follows: application of the herbicides paraquat, glyphosate or oxyfluorfen, addition of olive tree pruning residues, ploughing, sowing of oats+addition of crop residues+ploughing, sowing of Medicago sativa, sowing of oats and vetch+addition of crop residues and addition of oat straw. A non-treated plot was used as control soil and a plot under natural vegetation was used as a standard of local, high quality soil. The plots with addition of oat straw had higher values of enzymatic activity, microbial biomass and respiration, reaching similar values to soil under native vegetation. The lowest levels of soil biological quality indicators were observed in the plots with application of some type of herbicide. Low RQ values were observed in these plots as consequence of the scarce-null inputs of organic matter, suggesting an increase in organic matter recalcitrance.

  abstract = {Unsuitable agricultural practices can cause loss in soil quality and erodibility to thus increase or trigger desertification under Mediterranean conditions. A field experiment was performed at the El Teularet-Sierra de Enguera Experimental Station (eastern Spain) to assess the influence during a 5-yr period of different agricultural practices on physical and chemical indicators of soil quality (total and water-soluble carbohydrates, glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSP), total organic carbon, aggregate stability (AS), vegetation cover and soil erosion). The management practices included residual herbicide use, ploughing, ploughing + oats, addition of oat straw mulch and a control (land abandonment). Adjacent soil under natural vegetation was used as a reference for local, high-quality soil and as a control for comparison with the agricultural soils under different management practices. Oat straw mulching led to higher levels of water-soluble carbohydrates, GRSP and AS and lower soil erosion rates, resulting in values similar to those in the soil under native vegetation. The lowest levels of carbohydrates and GRSP were for the plots that were treated with herbicide or were ploughed. The maintenance of and increases in stable aggregates promoted by the different agricultural management practices over the years were attributed to increases in labile organic fractions such as carbohydrates and to the GRSP content. The results demonstrate that land abandonment (control plot) or the use of a cover (plants or straw) contributes to increases in soil quality and reduces the risk of erosion. The research also shows that sustainable agricultural management allows soil to recover and that the use of straw mulching is the most effective management strategy.},

Despite the abundance and diversity of these nematodes, studies on their contribution to N mineralization have been limited to a few selected species and often in completely sterilized media. Such simplified experiments are unrealistic and usually give inaccurate results as part of the interaction is missed. Therefore the contributions of nematodes to N mineralization need to be quantified more accurately in realistic conditions where native microbes, nematodes and plants interact. To do this, we set up a microcosm incubation experiment in which the whole nematode communities were extracted from fresh soil and reinoculated into the soil defaunated by 5. kGy dose gamma irradiation that leaves the microbial community largely intact. Three treatments namely control,+Nem (with nematodes) and-Nem (without nematodes), with or without plants were incubated for 86 days. In bare microcosms,+Nem cores increased total mineral nitrogen with 32\% compared to-Nem. However, no significant ( p{$>$}0.05) differences were observed on total mineral nitrogen and plant N uptake between+Nem and-Nem treatments in planted microcosms. Nematode abundances and community structures were significantly changed over time and differed in bare and planted microcosms. Bacterivores dominated in bare, while herbivores dominated in planted soils throughout the incubation period. This could explain the contrasting effects of nematodes in N mineralization in bare and planted microcosms. Optimization of gamma irradiation technique is required to further reduce its side effects on nutrient flush and non-targeted organisms. ?? 2013.},

While ecologists increasingly appreciate the importance of CUE, its core concepts remain ambiguous: terminology is inconsistent and confusing, methods capture variable temporal and spatial scales, and the significance of many fundamental drivers remains inconclusive. Here we outline the processes underlying microbial efficiency and propose a conceptual framework that structures the definition of CUE according to increasingly broad temporal and spatial drivers where (1) CUEP reflects population-scale carbon use efficiency of microbes governed by species-specific metabolic and thermodynamic constraints, (2) CUEC defines community-scale microbial efficiency as gross biomass production per unit substrate taken up over short time scales, largely excluding recycling of microbial necromass and exudates, and (3) CUEE reflects the ecosystem-scale efficiency of net microbial biomass production (growth) per unit substrate taken up as iterative breakdown and recycling of microbial products occurs. CUEE integrates all internal and extracellular constraints on CUE and hence embodies an ecosystem perspective that fully captures all drivers of microbial biomass synthesis and decay. These three definitions are distinct yet complementary, capturing the capacity for carbon storage in microbial biomass across different ecological scales. By unifying the existing concepts and terminology underlying microbial efficiency, our framework enhances data interpretation and theoretical advances.},

Multiple approaches are currently used to quantify CUE but the extent to which estimates reflect methodological variability is unknown. This limits our ability to apply or cross-compare published CUE values. Here we evaluated the performance of five methods in a single soil under standard conditions. The microbial response to three substrate amendment rates (0.0, 0.05, and 2.0 mg glucose-C g-1 soil) was examined using: 13C and 18O isotope tracing approaches which estimate CUE based on substrate uptake and growth dynamics; calorespirometry which infers growth and CUE from metabolic heat and respiration rates; metabolic flux analysis where CUE is determined as the balance between biosynthesis and respiration using position-specific 13CO2 production of labeled glucose; and stoichiometric modeling which derives CUE from elemental ratios of microbial biomass, substrate, and exoenzyme activity. The CUE estimates we obtained differed by method and substrate concentration, ranging under in situ conditions from {$<$} 0.4 for the substrate-nonspecific methods that do not use C tracers (18O, stoichiometric modeling) to {$>$} 0.6 for the substrate-specific methods that trace glucose use (13C method, calorespirometry, metabolic flux analysis). We explore the different aspects of microbial metabolism that each method captures and how this affects the interpretation of CUE estimates. We recommend that users consider the strengths and weaknesses of each method when choosing the technique that will best address their research needs.},

  abstract = {Using pre-established trial sites on allophanic soils, we investigated the impacts of long to medium-term pastoral management practices, such as fertilisation and grazing intensity, on a range of soil biological and biochemical properties; hot water-extractable C (HWC), water-soluble C (WSC), hot-water extractable total carbohydrates, microbial biomass-C and N and mineralisable N. These properties were examined for their usefulness as soil quality indicators responding to changes in the rhizosphere caused by management practices. Adjacent cropping, market garden and native bush sites located on similar soil types were included to determine the changes in soil biological and biochemical properties resulting from changes in land use. The seasonal variability of HWC and its relationship with other labile fractions of soil organic matter was also examined. Microbial biomass-C, mineralisable N and extractable total carbohydrates showed promise in differentiating treatment and land use effects. However, HWC was one of the most sensitive and consistent indicators examined at 52 different sites. The impact of different land uses on the amounts of HWC in the same soil type was far greater than that was observed for the soil organic carbon. The average values of HWC for soil under different land use were: native (4000 {$\mu$}g C g-1 soil), sheep/beef pastures (3400), dairy pastures (3000), cropping (1000) and market gardening soils (850). HWC was also sensitive to differences within an ecosystem, e.g. effects of grazing intensities and effects of N or P fertilisers on pastures. The sheep and beef/cattle grazed pastures always had higher amounts of HWC than the intensively grazed dairy pastures. Nitrogen fertiliser application (200 and 400 kg N ha-1 yr-1) over the previous 5 yr had significant (P {$<$} 0.001) negative impacts on HWC and other soil microbial properties. In contrast, long-term application of P fertilisers had a significant (P {$<$} 0.001) positive effect on the HWC levels in pastoral soils. In the case of long-term P trials, HWC increased even though no increase in the total soil carbon pool was detected. HWC was positively correlated with soil microbial biomass-C (R2 = 0.84), microbial nitrogen (R2 = 0.72), mineralisable N (R2 = 0.86), and total carbohydrates (R2 = 0.88). All these correlations were significant at P {$<$} 0.001 level of significance. The HWC was also positively correlated with WSC and total organic C. However, these correlations were poorer than those found for other soil parameters. Most of these measurements have been actively promoted as key indicators of soil quality. Given the strong correlations between HWC and other biochemical measurements, HWC could be used as an integrated measure of soil quality. When HWC is extracted, other pools of labile nutrients are also extracted along with C. Therefore it is suggested that decline in HWC would also indicate a decline in other labile organic pools of nutrients such as nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus. About 40-50\% of the C in the HWC extract was present as carbohydrates. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Understanding temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition from bulk soils and aggregates of long-term fertilized plots is imperative to forecast soil C dynamics. We evaluated the impacts of 43 years of fertilization under a soybean (Glycine max) based cropping system on temperature sensitivity of SOC decomposition (Q10) in an Alfisol. Treatments were: no mineral fertilizer or manure (control), 100\% recommended dose of nitrogen (N), N and phosphorus (NP), N, P and potassium (NPK), NPK~+~lime at 0.4~Mg~ha-1 (NPK~+~L), 150\% recommended NPK (150\% NPK), and NPK~+~farmyard manure (FYM) at 10~Mg~ha-1 (NPK~+~FYM). Bulk soils as well as macro- and micro-aggregates were incubated for 24~days at 25~\textdegree C and 35~\textdegree C. Cumulative SOC mineralization (Ct) in the 0\textendash 15~cm soil layer of bulk soils with NPK~+~FYM and NPK treated plots were similar but significantly higher than unfertilized control plots. However, both Ct and Q10 values in the NPK~+~FYM plots were higher than NPK in the 15\textendash 30~cm soil layer. In the 0\textendash 15~cm soil layer, NPK~+~FYM plots had {$\sim$}10 and 26\% greater Q10 values of macro- and microaggregates than NPK. Activation energies required for bulk soils C mineralization was {$\sim$}2 and 3 times higher in NPK~+~FYM and NPK~+~L plots, respectively, compared with unfertilized control plots in that layer. Lime along with NPK application increased the activation energy of SOC decomposition. Thus, long-term NPK~+~FYM and NPK~+~L applications have great potential for less proportional SOC decomposition than NPK or unfertilized control plots under a temperature rise in these acid soils. However, NPK~+~FYM management practice is recommended as it has highest SOC accumulation and can have less SOC losses under a temperature rise.},

The maximum increase in the microbial biomass, due to these inputs was observed under the manure + fertilizer treatment followed, in decreasing order, by manure alone and fertilizer alone. Within individual crop periods the levels of microbial biomass decreased sharply from the seedling to the flowering stage and then increased slightly with crop maturity. The maximum levels of microbial biomass C and P were observed during the summer fallow. The maximum accumulation of microbial biomass N occurred in the early rainy season, immediately after the soil amendments. Microbial biomass C, N, and P were positively related to each other throughout the annual cycle.},

  abstract = {The study examined the interrelationships between chemical and microbiological quality indicators of soil and their ability to differentiate plots under contrasting fertilization regimes. The study was based on a long-term field experiment established on an Udic Ustocrepts in 1966. The soil was cropped with maize (Zea mays L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and received no organic fertilization (control), wheat straw and maize stalk (crop residue) or cattle manure (manure) in combination with increasing levels of mineral N (N0 and N200). To asses whether seasonal fluctuations of measured properties might mask the effects of fertilization, soil samples were collected four times within a growing season. Manure amendment increased soil TOC and TN, while crop residue amendment had no significant effects. Mineral N increased TN only in April, while in September it decreased water extractable organic C (WEOC). Data of diffuse reflectance Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) gave evidence for a higher relative contribution of the aliphatic peak at 2930 cm-1 and a lower relative contribution of the aromatic peaks at 1620 cm-1 and 1520 cm-1 under manure. Manure amendment stimulated enzymatic activities, increased microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and total phospholipids (PLFAs), and reduced the metabolic quotient (qCO2). Patterns of PLFAs indicated that manure amendment increased the ratio of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria. Crop residue amendment had no significant effects, while in September mineral N inhibited protease activity and reduced the Gram-positive to Gram-negative ratio. Microbial-related parameters fluctuated over time but their seasonality did not hamper the identification of fertilization-induced effects. The selected properties proved to be valuable indicators of long-term changes of soil quality and were strongly interrelated: changes in soil organic matter content and composition induced by manure amendment were accompanied by changes in abundance and function of the soil microbial community. Partial least square analysis obtained relating DRIFTS spectra to measured soil properties produced accurate predictive models for TOC and PLFAs, and moderately accurate models for Cmic, showing the potential of DRIFTS to be used as a rapid soil testing technique for soil quality monitoring.},

  abstract = {The chemical composition of soil organic matter (SOM) is a key determinant of its biological stability. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the effects of various sources of supplemental N on the chemical composition of SOM in the fine ({$<$}5 {$\mu$}m) mineral fraction. Treatments were fallow, maize/soybean in rotation, and continuous maize receiving no fertilizer (maize0N), synthetic fertilizer N (maize + N), or composted manure (maize + manure). The chemical structures in SOM associated with the fine fraction were determined using XANES spectroscopy at the C and N K-edges, which was assessed using multidimensional scaling. Analysis of amino sugar biomarkers were used to evaluate the fungal:bacterial contributions to the SOM. The addition of N to soils (i.e., maize + N, maize + manure, and maize/soybean treatments) resulted in the enrichment of proteinaceous compounds. Soils which did not receive supplemental N (i.e., fallow and maize0N treatments) were enriched in plant-derived compounds (e.g., aromatics, phenolics, carboxylic acids and aliphatic compounds), suggesting that decomposition of plant residues was constrained by N-limitation. Microbial populations assessed by amino sugar biomarker ratios showed that the highest contributions to SOM by bacteria occurred in the maize + manure treatment (high N input), and by fungi in the fallow treatment (low N input). The SOM in the maize + N and maize/soybean treatments was enriched in N-bonded aromatics; we attribute this enrichment to the abiotic reaction of inorganic N with organic C structures. The SOM in the maize + manure treatment was enriched in pyridinic-N, likely as a result of intense microbial processing and high SOM turnover. The presences of signals for ketone and pyrrole compounds in XANES spectra suggest their use as biomarkers for microbially transformed and stabilized SOM. The SOM in the maize + manure treatment was enriched in ketones which are likely microbial by-products of fatty acid catabolism. Pyrrole compounds, which may accumulate over the long term as by-products of protein transformations by an N-limited microbial community, were dominant in the fallow soil. A combination of molecular spectroscopy and biomarker analysis showed that the source of supplemental N to soil influences the stable C- and N-containing compounds of SOM in a long-term field study. Indeed, any increase in N availability allowed the microbial community to transform plant material into microbial by-products which occur as stable SOM compounds in the fine soil fraction. \textcopyright{} 2013 UK Crown.},

  abstract = {The flow of carbon (C) through soil is inherently complex due to the many thousands of different chemical transformations occurring simultaneously within the soil microbial community. The accurate modelling of this C flow therefore represents a major challenge. In response to this, isotopic tracers (e.g. 13C, 14C) are commonly used to experimentally parameterise models describing the fate and residence time of individual C compounds within soil. In this study, we critically evaluated the combined use of experimental 14C labelling and mathematical modelling to estimate C turnover times in soil. We applied 14C-labelled alanine and glucose to an agricultural soil and simultaneously measured their loss from soil solution alongside the rate of microbial C immobilization and mineralization. Our results revealed that chloroform fumigation-extraction (CFE) cannot be used to reliably quantify the amount of isotopically labelled 13C/14C immobilised by the microbial biomass. This is due to uncertainty in the extraction efficiency values (kec) within the CFE methodology which are both substrate and incubation time dependent. Further, the traditional mineralization approach (i.e. measuring 14/13CO2 evolution) provided a poor estimate of substrate loss from soil solution and mainly reflected rates of internal microbial C metabolism after substrate uptake from the soil. Therefore, while isotope addition provides a simple mechanism for labelling the microbial biomass it provides limited information on the behaviour of the substrate itself. We used our experimental data to construct a new empirical model to describe the simultaneous flow of substrate-C between key C pools in soil. This model provided a superior estimate of microbial substrate use and microbial respiration flux in comparison to traditional first order kinetic modelling approaches. We also identify a range of fundamental problems associated with the modelling of isotopic-C in soil, including issues with variation in C partitioning within the community, model pool connectivity and variation in isotopic pool dilution, which make interpretation of any C isotopic flux data difficult. We conclude that while convenient, the use of isotopic data (13C, 14C, 15N) has many potential pitfalls necessitating a critical evaluation of both past and future studies.},

  abstract = {Current attempts to explain the persistence of carbon in soils focuses on explanations such as the recalcitrant plant residues and the physical isolation of substrates from decomposers. A pool of organic matter that can persist for centuries to millennia is hypothesized because of the evidence provided by the persistence of pre-disturbance C in fallow or vegetation change experiments, and the radiocarbon age of soil carbon. However, new information, which became available through advances in the ability to measure the isotope signatures of specific compounds, favors a new picture of organic matter dynamics. Instead of persistence of plant-derived residues like lignin in the soil, the majority of mineral soil is in molecules derived from microbial synthesis. Carbon recycled multiple times through the microbial community can be old, decoupling the radiocarbon age of C atoms from the chemical or biological lability of the molecules they comprise. In consequence is soil microbiology, a major control on soil carbon dynamics, which highlights the potential vulnerability of soil organic matter to changing environmental conditions. Moreover, it emphasizes the need to devise new management options to restore, increase, and secure this valuable resource. ? 2013 The Author(s).},

This has important implications on soil productivity and the potential of using soils to enhance soil C storage and reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere for mitigating predicted climate changes. Glo- bally, most agricultural and degraded soils can provide significant potential sinks for atmo- spheric CO2, However, soil C accumulation does not continue to increase with time with increasing C inputs but reaches an upper limit or "C saturation level," which governs the ultimate limit of soil C sink. The control of this limit relies on understanding soil C stabili- zation mechanisms. Physical mechanisms such as protection of SOC by soil minerals are better known while chemical and biological mechanisms are less well known, requiring more experimental data for verification and validation. No study has yet compared the rela- tive significance of each of the proposed major mechanisms in a given soil type and climate. Continued research on this and related aspects are needed if soils are to be relied upon for food and fibre production and for the mitigation of climate change.},

The occluded organic materials, released as a result of aggregate disruption, were in various stages of decomposition and had different degrees of association with mineral particles. Changes in the degree of association of occluded organic materials and mineral particles with decomposition are discussed and form the basis of a model which illustrates the simultaneous dynamics of microaggregates and their organic cores.

The SMB is living and dynamic, and its activity is responsible for the regulation of organic matter transformations and associated energy and nutrient cycling in soil. At a gross level, an increase in SMB is considered beneficial, while a decline in SMB may be considered detrimental if this leads to a decline in biological function. However, absolute SMB values are more difficult to interpret. Target or reference values of SMB are needed for soil quality assessments and to allow ameliorative action to be taken at an appropriate time. However, critical values have not yet been successfully identified for SMB. This paper provides a conceptual framework which outlines how SMB values could be interpreted and measured, with examples provided within an Australian context.},

It is perhaps less appreciated that natural and managed soils are an important source and sink for atmospheric CO2 and that, primarily as a result of the activities of soil microorganisms, there is a soil-derived respiratory flux of CO2 to the atmosphere that overshadows by tenfold the annual CO2 flux from fossil fuel emissions. Therefore small changes in the soil carbon cycle could have large impacts on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Here we discuss the role of soil microbes in the global carbon cycle and review the main methods that have been used to identify the microorganisms responsible for the processing of plant photosynthetic carbon inputs to soil. We discuss whether application of these techniques can provide the information required to underpin the management of agro-ecosystems for carbon sequestration and increased agricultural sustainability. We conclude that, although crucial in enabling the identification of plant-derived carbon-utilising microbes, current technologies lack the high-throughput ability to quantitatively apportion carbon use by phylogentic groups and its use efficiency and destination within the microbial metabolome. It is this information that is required to inform rational manipulation of the plant-soil system to favour organisms or physiologies most important for promoting soil carbon storage in agricultural soil.},

  abstract = {The densely populated, intensively cropped subtropical highlands of the world have agricultural sustainability problems from soil erosion and fertility decline. In 1991, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) initiated a long-term field experiment at its semi-arid highland experiment station in Mexico (2240 masl; 19.31\textdegree N, 98.50\textdegree W; Cumulic Phaeozem) to investigate the long-term effects of tillage/seeding practices, crop rotations, and crop residue management on maize and wheat grown under rainfed conditions. Soil ecology status contributes to agricultural system sustainability, and evaluations were made to determine the effect of different management practices on soil microbial biomass (SMB) (substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and chloroform fumigation incubation (CFI)) and micro-flora physiological and catabolic diversity (BIOLOG\texttrademark{} ecoplate well system). SMB-C (CFI, SIR) was significantly and respectively 1.2 and 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average 387 mg C kg-1dry soil and 515 mg C kg-1dry soil, respectively) compared to residue removal. SMB-C (CFI) was significantly higher for wheat (369 mg C kg-1dry soil) compared to maize (319 mg C kg-1dry soil). SMB-N (CFI) was significantly 1.3 times higher for residue retention (average 28 mg N kg-1dry soil) compared to residue removal. The average well color development (AWCD) obtained by the BIOLOG\texttrademark{} ecoplate essay indicated there were large differences in the catabolic capability of soil microbial communities after 15 years of contrasting management practices. While maize and wheat rotation under conventional tillage with residue retention showed a significantly higher overall AWCD value compared to the other treatments, AWCD of maize with zero tillage and residue removal was significantly lower than in the other treatments. AWCD was significantly higher for residue retention compared to residue removal and for wheat as compared to maize. For maize, the management practices were divided into two groups; zero tillage with residue removal was separate from all other treatments. For wheat, conventional tillage was separate from all zero tillage treatments. This study suggests that in the target area, a cropping system that includes zero tillage, crop rotation, and crop residue retention can increase overall biomass and micro-flora activity and diversity compared with common farming practices. In the long term, zero tillage combined with residue retention creates conditions favourable for the development of antagonists and predators, and fosters a new ecological stability. Zero tillage without residue retention is an unsustainable practice that leads to poor soil health in the long run. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Total root mass was similar under burning and trashing but under trashing there was a redistribution of roots towards the surface 0-10 cm in the inter-row space as roots proliferated beneath the trash mulch. Soil organic C content decreased in response to both increasing distance from the plant row (to a depth of 20 cm) and burning rather than trashing (to a depth of 10 cm). Declines in K2SO4-extractable C, light fraction C, microbial biomass C, basal respiration and aggregate stability in response to distance and burning were much more marked than those for organic C and occurred to a depth of 30 cm. Bulk density was greater under burnt than trashed sugarcane and was greater in the inter-row than row, particularly under burning. Heterotrophic functional diversity (measured by analysis of catabolic response profiles to 36 substrates) was also investigated. Principal component analysis of response profiles demonstrated that soils below the row and those under trashing at 30 cm out from this row were separated from the other soils on PC1 and the sample from the inter-row centre (60 cm out) under burning was separated from the others on PC2. Catabolic evenness was least for the latter soil. It was concluded that soil in the inter-row of burnt sugarcane receives few inputs of organic matter and that conversion to green cane harvesting with retention of a trash mulch greatly improves the organic matter, microbial and physical status of the inter-row soil. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, rates of C accumulation and underlying mechanisms have rarely been determined for a range of managed and successional ecosystems on the same soil type. We determined soil organic matter (SOM) fractions with the highest potential for sequestering C in ten ecosystems on the same soil series using both density- and incubation-based fractionation methods. Ecosystems included four annual row-crop systems (conventional, low input,  organic and no-till), two perennial cropping systems (alfalfa and poplar), and four native ecosystems (early successional, midsuccessional historically tilled, midsuccessional never-tilled, and late successional forest). Enhanced C storage to 5~cm relative to conventional agriculture ranged from 8.9~g~C~m-2~y-1 in low input row crops to 31.6~g~C~m-2~y-1 in the early successional ecosystem. Carbon sequestration across all ecosystems occurred in aggregate-associated pools larger than 53~{$\mu$}m. The density-based fractionation scheme identified heavy-fraction C pools (SOM~{$>~$}1.6~g~cm-3 plus SOM~{$<~$}53~{$\mu$}m), particularly those in macroaggregates ({$>$}250~{$\mu$}m), as having the highest potential C accumulation rates, ranging from 8.79 g~C~m-2~y-1 in low input row crops to 29.22~g~C~m-2~y-1 in the alfalfa ecosystem. Intra-aggregate light fraction pools accumulated C at slower rates, but generally faster than in inter-aggregate LF pools. Incubation-based methods that fractionated soil into active, slow and passive pools showed that C accumulated primarily in slow and resistant pools. However, crushing aggregates in a manner that simulates tillage resulted in a substantial transfer of C from slow pools with field mean residence times of decades to active pools with mean residence times of only weeks. Our results demonstrate that soil C accumulates almost entirely in soil aggregates, mostly in macroaggregates, following reductions in land use intensity. The potentially rapid destruction of macroaggregates following tillage, however, raises concerns about the long-term persistence of these C pools.},

  abstract = {Soluble organic matter and its biodegradability are important in relation to soil nutrient fluxes, carbon (C) sequestration, and water quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the quantity and biodegradability of soluble organic matter in soil under monoculture maize or maize-soybean rotation, and different amendments: manure, inorganic fertilizer, or no amendment. We characterized organic matter extracted in cold and hot (80 \textdegree C) water by using a bioassay involving incubation of the extracts (after inoculation with soil microflora) at 35 \textdegree C for 42 days. Soluble organic C and organic and mineral nitrogen (N) were monitored during the incubation. Extracts of whole soil (0\textendash 15 cm depth) and three water-stable aggregate size classes ({$>$}1000, 1000\textendash 250, and 250\textendash 50 {$\mu$}m) were subjected to the bioassay in order to evaluate the physical disposition and kinetics of soluble organic matter. Hot water-soluble C accounted for about 70\% of the total (cold+hot) water-soluble organic matter. Organic N was the major form of N in the extracts; it comprised 61\textendash 83\% of the total N extracted with cold water and 87\textendash 97\% of the total N extracted with hot water. The quantity of soluble organic matter that was biodegradable was related to the extraction procedure and the management history of the soil. The proportion of soluble C and organic N that was biodegradable was greatest in hot water extracts and greater in manured than nonmanured soils. During the bioassay, proportionately greater amounts of organic N were metabolized relative to organic C, so that the C:N ratios of the extracts widened as the incubation progressed, indicating that the soluble organic matter was rich in labile organic N. The rate at which soluble organic matter decomposed (i.e., turnover) was not related to the type of input. Decomposition data fitted a double exponential decay model, suggesting that the soluble organic matter comprised two fractions: a rapidly decomposable fraction (containing 29\textendash 36\% of the total soluble C) with a turnover time of {$<$}1 day, and a slowly decomposable fraction with a turnover time of about 80 days. The concentration of soluble organic matter in soil aggregates was related to aggregate size; the concentration was greatest in the largest aggregates and it decreased with decreasing aggregate size. Soluble organic C extracted from aggregates also comprised two kinetically discrete pools. The turnover time (i.e., mean residence time) of each pool was not affected by amendment, crop rotation, or aggregate size. However, the slowly decomposable organic C pool was larger in microaggregates ({$<$}250 {$\mu$}m) than in macroaggregates, whereas the rapidly decomposable pool was larger in macroaggregates. We conclude that water-soluble organic matter in maize-cropped soils comprises two kinetically defined fractions and is readily decomposable due to its high content of hydrophilic, labile N-rich compounds.},

  abstract = {Some basic concepts concerning soil physical factors have been briefly discussed. The importance of evaluation of the total soil moisture stress, as indicative of the energy which must be used by an organism to gain water from the soil, is shown. This total stress can be divided into tensiometric and osmotic components, of which the latter is important only in saline or heavily fertilized soils and is but briefly mentioned. Tensiometric suction is discussed and shown to be best described along with a measure of the texture and structure of the soil by means of the moisture characteristic. From such a characteristic, additional information concerning porosity and aeration can be obtained. Although there are few published experiments in which suction has been measured, none suggests a limitation of fungal growth directly due to suction factors in the soils between saturation and the permanent wilting point of mesophytic higher plants. Evidence derived from controlled humidity experiments reveals that most fungi can exert sufficient force to absorb water from atmospheres at a lower relative humidity than those in equilibrium with soil at the permanent wilting point. It is then suggested that absorption of soil water per unit area of absorptive surface will need to occur much less rapidly in the case of soil fungi than of higher plants, so that the growth of the former will not be limited to the same extent by reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of the soil. The conclusion is drawn that the majority of fungi will probably be able to grow in soils somewhat, or even considerably, drier than the permanent wilting point of higher plants. From an examination of the evidence it is concluded that in a compact soil spores are dispersed by the soil water only when that water is moving through a nearly saturated soil. In natural soils, however, where cracks, root channels, etc., are present, rapid movement of water, and thus of spores, may take place to a considerable depth even when the general soil mass is far from saturated. The literature reveals that such factors as moisture content, texture and structure, which affect soil aeration, have a profound influence on fungal activity and it is postulated that aeration is, in fact, the effective agent. Although the evidence is far from adequate, it appears that both excess of carbon dioxide and an insufficiency of oxygen are implicated as inhibitors. I wish to pay particular tribute to Professor N. Collis-George who provided the initial stimulus for me to begin investigations in the field which forms the topic of this article and who has been of much assistance to me in discussion. I also wish to thank Dr E. C. Childs and Dr S. D. Garrett for discussion and for reading and criticizing various sections of the manuscript and to thank Dr D. J. Greenwood for advice concerning soil aeration. I am grateful to Professor H. Godwin for providing accommodation for me at the Botany School, Cambridge, for a period during which this article was written.},

  abstract = {A technique based on progressive fumigation was used to reduce soil microbial biodiversity, and the effects of such reductions upon the stability of key soil processes were measured. Mineral soil samples from a grassland were fumigated with chloroform for up to 24 h and then incubated for 5 months to allow recolonisation by surviving organisms. The diversity of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria, protozoa and nematodes was progressively reduced by increasing fumigation times, as was the number of trophic groups, phyla within trophic groups, and taxa within phyla. Total microbial biomass was similar within fumigated soils, but lower than for unfumigated soil. There was no direct relationship between biodiversity and function. Some broad-scale functional parameters increased as biodiversity decreased, e.g. thymidine incorporation, growth on added nutrients, and the decomposition rate of plant residues. Other more specific parameters decreased as biodiversity decreased, e.g. nitrification, denitrification and methane oxidation. Thus specific functional parameters may be a more sensitive indicator of environmental change than general parameters. Although fumigation reduced soil microbial biodiversity, there was evidence to suggest that it selected for organisms with particular physiological characteristics. The consequences of this for interpreting biodiversity \textendash{} function relationships are discussed. The stability of the resulting communities to perturbation was further examined by imposing a transient (brief heating to 40\textdegree C) or a persistent (addition of CuSO4) stress. Decomposition of grass residues was determined on three occasions after such perturbations. The soils clearly demonstrated resilience to the transient stress; decomposition rates were initially depressed by the stress and recovered over time. Resilience was reduced in the soils with decreasing biodiversity. Soils were not resilient to the persistent stress, there was no recovery in decomposition rate over time, but the soils with the highest biodiversity were more resistant to the stress than soils with impaired biodiversity. The study of functional stability under applied perturbation is a powerful means of examining the effects of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Profound shifts have occurred during the last three centuries in which human actions have become the main driver to global environmental change. In this new epoch, the Anthropocene, human-driven changes such as population growth, climate, and land use change are pushing the Earth system well outside of its normal operating range, causing severe and abrupt environmental change. In the Anthropocene, soil change and soil formation or degradation have also accelerated, jeopardizing soil quality and health. Thus, the need for up-to-date, high-quality, high-resolution, spatiotemporal, and continuous soil and environmental data that characterize the physicochemical, biological, and hydrologic conditions of ecosystems across continents has intensified. These needs are in sharp contrast to available digital soil data representing continental and global soil systems, which only provide coarse-scale (1:1,000,000 or coarser) vector polygon maps with highly aggregated soil classes represented in the form of crisp map units derived from historic observations, lacking site-specific pedogenic process knowledge, and only indirectly relating to pressing issues of the Anthropocene. Furthermore, most available global soil data are snapshots in time, lacking the information necessary to document the evolution of soil properties and processes. Recently, major advancements in digital soil mapping and modeling through geographic information technologies, incorporation of soil and remote sensing products, and advanced quantitative methods have produced domain-specific soil property prediction models constrained to specific geographic regions, which have culminated in the vision for a global pixel-based soil map. To respond to the challenges soil scientists face in the Anthropocene, we propose a space\textendash time modeling framework called STEP-AWBH (``step-up''), explicitly incorporating anthropogenic forcings to optimize the soil pixel of the futurevv.},

Mineral fertilization reduced the growth of AMF, as estimated using both measurements of hyphal length and the signature fatty acid 16:1omega5, whereas manuring alone increased the growth of AMF. The results of AMF root colonization followed the same pattern as AMF hyphal length in soil samples, but not AMF spore densities, which increased with increasing mineral and organic fertilization.

  abstract = {Soils are highly complex environments characterized by a huge diversity of organisms (especially microorganisms) and chemical compounds and by complex physical structure. Because of this complexity, it is often difficult to manipulate independently the microbial community, the organic matter, the clay types, etc., and to disentangle the various processes involved in soil functioning. In this paper, we propose the use of artificial soils as a simplified and adjustable tool to disentangle soil processes and test ecological theories on microbial communities. To create an artificial soil, a protocol was designed based on commercially available clays, sand, calcium carbonates and humic acids. Special attention was paid to aggregates and structure formation using differential sieving. Many aspects of our artificial soil can be adjusted as needed by altering mineral nutrient or humic acid concentrations, addition of other organic molecules, varying the quality of clays, etc. The advantage of an artificial soil is that chemical and biological diversity as compared with real soils can be reduced so that the effects of manipulations (adding an organism or a molecule, changing temperature, etc.) are not confounded by uncontrolled interactions. To test the capability of this artificial soil to support microbial growth and dynamics, six bacterial strains were independently inoculated and monitored for 19 days. Each strain was able to grow and mineralize the available organic matter. This artificial soil could thus be a good tool for studying different aspects of soil functioning. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Field and laboratory studies combined with destructive and nondestructive analytical methods were used to characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM) in acid forest soils. DOM is produced in significant amounts in the forest canopy and in the forest floor. A major part of the organic solutes are lignocellulose-degradation products being strongly microbially altered in the course of ligninolysis. The release of lignin-derived moieties into the soil solution is controlled by their degree of biooxidation. Microorganisms contribute also directly to the organic solutes through the release of microbial metabolites. DOM released from the forest floor passes the upper mineral soil almost conservatively, whereas in the subsoil most DOM is removed from solution. Immobilization of DOM is mainly due to sorption on Fe and Al oxides. The highly oxidized lignin-derived moieties are preferentially removed from the soil solution whereas the saccharides are relatively enriched. We conclude that DOM in the forest soil output to the hydrosphere is a result of (1) the release of microbially degraded lignocellulose compounds and of microbial metabolites into the forest floor solution and (2) selective sorptive removal of the lignin-derived constituents in the subsoil.},

Our aim was to follow the aggregate formation and stabilization of organic matter in a controlled laboratory experiment, where microaggregates (53-250 ??m) obtained by slaking of a cultivated Duroc loam (finesilty, mixed, mesic Pachic Haplustoll) were incubated with 13C-labelled granular starch equivalent to 8 mg starch-C g-1 soil. Over 71 d we measured the size distribution of water-stable aggregates, followed the dynamics of native and labelled C within the aggregate-size classes, and estimated the development of the microbial biomass by chloroform fumigation-extraction and by direct counting. After an initial flush of starch decomposition, at d 4 macroaggregates (250-8000 ??m) represented 56\% of the soil mass and contained 6.3 mg starch-derived C g-1 soil compared with 1.6 mg starch-derived C g-1 soil in the 53-250-??m microaggregates. The concentration of starch-derived C isolated in microbial biomass at d 4 was 3270 ??g g-1 soil in the macroaggregates and 630 ??m g-1 soil in the microaggregates and declined thereafter in both size classes. At d 4, fungal biomass predominated the microbial community in the macroaggregates, in all other samples bacterial biomass predominated. The mass of soil found in macroaggregates did not follow the decline in fungal and bacterial biomass with incubation-time but remained constant. Except at the last sampling date, we observed no formation of macroaggregates in the control samples (incubated without starch amendment), and the undecomposed starch did not glue microaggregates into macroaggregates either. We suggest that microhabitats enriched in substrate acted as 'hot spots' for fungal growth towards and on these sources. In accordance with previous studies, the resulting filamentous entanglement of primary particles and microaggregates formed macroaggregates. However, the stabilization of the macroaggregates throughout the experiment may be attributed to other factors that persist after cell death of the microorganisms. In situ mineralization rate constants of labelled C were much lower for the microaggregates, compared with those of the macroaggregates, indicating a better stabilization of starch-derived C within the microaggregates, and thus supporting the macroaggregate-microaggregate conceptual model.},

To assess the effects of land cover and parental material on soil biogeochemistry, we studied 120 soil samples collected from various ecosystems in Burgundy, France. The potential solubility and aromaticity of dissolved organic matter was characterised by pressurised hot-water extraction of organic carbon (PH-WEOC). Soil physico-chemical characteristics (pH, texture, soil carbon and nitrogen) were measured, as was the {$\delta$}13C signature both in soils and in PH-WEOC. We also determined bacterial and fungal abundance and the genetic structure of bacterial communities. Our results show that the potential solubility of soil organic carbon is correlated to carbon and clay content in the soil. The aromaticity of PH-WEOC and its {$\delta$}13C signature reflect differences in the decomposition pathways of soil organic matter and in the production of water-extractable organic compounds, in relation to land cover. The genetic structure of bacterial communities is related to soil texture and pH, and to PH-WEOC, revealing that water-extractable organic matter is closely related to the dynamics of bacterial communities. This comprehensive study, at the regional scale, thus provides better definition of the relationships between water-extractable organic matter and soil biogeochemical properties.},

  abstract = {Sugars are the most abundant organic compounds in the biosphere because they are monomers of all polysaccharides. We summarize the results of the last 40 years on the sources, content, composition and fate of sugars in soil and discuss their main functions. We especially focus on sugar uptake, utilization and recycling by microorganisms as this is by far the dominating process of sugar transformation in soil compared to sorption, leaching or plant uptake. Moreover, sugars are the most important carbon (C) and energy source for soil microorganisms.Two databases have been created. The 1st database focused on the contents of cellulose, non-cellulose, hot-water and cold-water extractable sugars in soils (348 data, 32 studies). This enabled determining the primary (plant-derived) and secondary (microbially and soil organic matter (SOM) derived) sources of carbohydrates in soil based on the galactose + mannose/arabinose + xylose (GM/AX) ratio. The 2nd database focused on the fate of sugar C in soils (734 data pairs, 32 studies using 13C or 14C labeled sugars). 13C and 14C dynamics enabled calculating the: 1) initial rate of sugar mineralization, 2) mean residence time (MRT) of C of the applied sugars, and 3) MRT of sugar C incorporated into 3a) microbial biomass and 3b) SOM.The content of hexoses was 3-4 times higher than pentoses, because hexoses originate from plants and microorganisms. The GM/AX ratio of non-cellulose sugars revealed a lower contribution of hexoses in cropland and grassland (ratio 0.7-1) compare to forest (ratio 1.5) soils.13C and 14C studies showed very high initial rate of glucose mineralization (1.1\% min-1) and much higher rate of sugars uptake by microorganisms from the soil solution. Considering this rate along with the glucose input from plants and its content in soil solution, we estimate that only about 20\% of all sugars in soil originate from the primary source - decomposition of plant litter and rhizodeposits. The remaining 80\% originates from the secondary source - microorganisms and their residues. The estimated MRT of sugar C in microbial biomass was about 230 days, showing intense and efficient internal recycling within microorganisms. The assessed MRT of sugar C in SOM was about 360 days, reflecting the considerable accumulation of sugar C in microbial residues and its comparatively slow external recycling.The very rapid uptake of sugars by microorganisms and intensive recycling clearly demonstrate the importance of sugars for microbes in soil. We speculate that the most important functions of sugars in soil are to maintain and stimulate microbial activities in the rhizosphere and detritusphere leading to mobilization of nutrients by accelerated SOM decomposition - priming effects. We conclude that the actual contribution of sugar C (not only whole sugar molecules, which are usually determined) to SOM is much higher than the 10 {$\pm$} 5\% commonly measured based on their content.},

The objective was to determine the effect of long-term management on the rate of mineralization of compost, in relation to soil biological activity. A compost was added at a rate of 5 or 15\% (wt/wt) to soil samples obtained from two treatments of a 30 year old N-management experiment: M0-without any N input, and M2-with 10 applications of 90 t cattle manure ha-1. Inorganic N accumulation and weekly rates of CO2 evolution were determined periodically during an incubation of 33 weeks. Microbial counts and dehydrogenase and protease activity were determined during 42 days. Net N mineralization was higher in M2 than in M0 soil, and was proportional to the amount of compost added. The recovery of compost-N as inorganic N was independent of soil management history and of compost application rate. The amount of N released was estimated (by difference) to be 26\% of compost N added. Initially 7-10\% was inorganic N and 8\% soluble organic N, therefore only 8-11\% was released from insoluble N in the compost. CO2 evolution was greater from M2 than from M0 soil only during the first week, but it was significantly affected by compost application throughout the experiment. The percentage recovery of compost-C as CO2 was smaller at the high application rate. Microbial counts and enzyme activities exhibited a periodical behavior. They were significantly affected by soil management history, and by compost, but the effect of compost was greater. The difference in biological activity between soils seemed to be related to the difference in their initial readily-available C and it did not significantly affect the rate of compost decomposition.},

The formation and stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) are major concerns in the context of global change for carbon sequestration and soil health. It is presently believed that lignin is not selectively preserved in soil and that chemically labile compounds bonding to minerals comprise a large fraction of the SOM. Labile plant inputs have been suggested to be the main precursor of the mineral-bonded SOM. Litter decomposition and SOM formation are expected to have temperature sensitivity varying with the lability of plant inputs. We tested this framework using dual 13 C and 15 N differentially labeled plant material to distinguish the metabolic and structural components within a single plant material. Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) seedlings were grown in an enriched 13 C and 15 N environment and then prior to harvest, removed from the enriched environment and allowed to incorporate natural abundance 13 C-CO 2 and 15 N fertilizer into the metabolic plant components. This enabled us to a chieve a greater than one atom \% difference in 13 C between the metabolic and structural components within the plant litter. This differentially labeled litter was incubated in soil at 15 and 35~\textdegree C, for 386~days with CO 2 measured throughout the incubation. After 14, 28, 147, and 386~days of incubation, the soil was subsequently fractionated. There was no difference in temperature sensitivity of the metabolic and structural components with regard to how much was respired or in the amount of litter biomass stabilized. Only the metabolic litter component was found in the sand, silt, or clay fraction while the structural component was exclusively found in the light fraction. These results support the stabilization framework that labile plant components are the main precursor of mineral-associated organic matter.},

Art materials differ in fluidity and are postulated to thus differentially enhance emotional response (the more fluid the material the more emotion elicited). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, this assumption has not been empirically tested. The current study aimed to examine the emotional and physiological responses to art-making with different art materials. We were particularly interested in vagal activity, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), because of its association with numerous health related outcomes. In this study, 50 adults (mean age 33 {$\pm$} 10.27 years, 52\% males) participated in a repeated measures experiment, in which they were requested to draw with three art materials (order randomized) differing in their level of fluidity (pencil, oil-pastels, and gouache paint) intermittent with periods of music. We measured the emotional response to art-making with each material using a self-report measure and matrices of HRV using a wearable electrocardiogram device. We calculated two indices of HRV, one indicative of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity, and one indicative of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. Art-making with gouache paint and oil-pastels resulted in improved positive mood, while pencil did not. Art-making explained approximately 35\% of the variability in parasympathetic reactivity, which may indicate changes in emotional regulation processes during the art-making task. Yet, fluidity was not sufficient to explain the reaction to art-making. Surprisingly, the largest suppression of PNS and augmentation of the SNS occurred during art-making with oil-pastels and not with Gouache. Moreover, PNS and SNS reactivity to oil-pastels were related to emotional valance, which may point to emotional engagement. We can conclude that art-making with oil-pastels, first created in Japan in 1924 to increase self-expression of students, results in a unique emotional and physiological responses. These findings might be explained by the enhanced tactile experience of art-making with oil-pastels along with their relative fluidity, triggering an arousal pattern. Further studies that take the format and presentation of the materials as well as the content of the artwork, into account, are needed.},

We have investigated the influence of14C-glucose addition on the mineralisation of charred maize and rye residues (thermally altered at 350\textdegree C) and oak wood (thermally altered at 800\textdegree C). The different BC materials were mixed with sand and incubated for 60 days at 20\textdegree C. The samples received 20 {$\mu$}g glucose-C per mg black carbon at the beginning and at day 26 of the experiment. At the beginning, a nutrient solution [(NH4)2SO4+KH2PO4] and an inoculum extracted from an arable soil were added. In the controls without glucose addition, between 0.3\% (wood) and 0.8\% (maize) of the initial charred materials were mineralised and 0.6-1.2\% when glucose was added. The two glucose additions accelerated BC mineralisation, with the second addition inducing a stronger enhancement of mineralisation than the first one. A close correlation (r=0.94, p{$<$}0.001) between glucose mineralisation and additional BC mineralisation suggests that BC degradation may be due to co-metabolism, i.e. to the enhanced growth of microbial biomass and the accompanying increased enzyme production. On the other hand, glucose mineralisation was enhanced over the control by the presence of charred material, i.e., there was an interactive priming of BC and glucose mineralisation. We conclude that BC in soils may promote growth of microorganisms and the decomposition of labile C compounds rather than stabilise them against degradation. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {It is well established that certain substrate additions to soils may accelerate or retard the mineralisation of soil organic matter. But up to now, research on these so called 'priming effects' was almost exclusively conducted with arable soils and with plant residues or glucose as additives. In this study, the effects of the uniformly14C-labelled substrates fructose, alanine, oxalic acid and catechol on the mineralisation of soil organic carbon (SOC) from different horizons of two forest soils (Haplic Podzol and Dystric Cambisol) and one arable soil (Haplic Phaeozem) under maize and rye cultivation were investigated in incubation experiments for 26 days. Apart from the controls, all samples received substrate additions of 13.3 {$\mu$}g substrate-C mg-1Corg. During the incubation, CO2-evolution was measured hourly and the amount of14CO2was determined at various time intervals. In almost all soils, priming effects were induced by one or several of the added substrates. The strongest positive priming effects were induced by fructose and alanine and occurred in the Bs horizon of the Haplic Podzol, where SOC mineralisation was nearly doubled. In the other soil samples, these substrates enhanced SOC mineralisation by +10 to +63\%. Catechol additions generally reduced SOC mineralisation by -12 to -43\% except in the EA horizon of the Haplic Podzol where SOC-borne CO2-evolution increased by +46\%. Oxalic acid also induced negative as well as positive priming effects ranging from -24 to +82\%. The data indicate that priming effects are ubiquitously occurring in surface and subsoil horizons of forest soils as well as in arable soils. Although a broad variety of soils was used within this study, relationships between soil properties and priming effects could not be ascertained. Therefore, a prediction on occurrence and magnitude of priming effects based on relatively easily measurable chemical and physical soil properties was not possible. Nevertheless, the data suggest that positive priming effects are most pronounced in forest soils that contain SOC of low biodegradability, where the added substrates may act as an important energy source for microbial metabolism. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In incubation experiments with soil samples from two forest soil profiles (Dystric Cambisol, Haplic Podzol), we investigated the influence of the addition of easily available14C-labelled organic substrates on the mineralisation of soil organic carbon (SOC). Substrates were added in combination (fructose, alanine) or repeatedly at different time intervals (fructose, alanine, oxalic acid, catechol). During the 1-4-month incubation, CO2-evolution was monitored hourly, while14CO2and microbial biomass12C and14C were determined at different time intervals. The combined addition of fructose and alanine to the Bs horizon of the Haplic Podzol induced a higher positive priming effect (+127\%) than the single substrate additions (+91\% and +85\%, respectively). During the first 4 days, seven times more SOC was mineralised than in the control, while microbial biomass only increased by a factor of 1.4. These results and the C-balance at the end of the incubation indicate that the observed priming effects can not be solely attributed to co-metabolism or to the turnover of microbial biomass. When added repeatedly, most substrates induced higher positive priming effects, than single additions, thus indicating that the SOC pool affected by priming was not depleted. Since priming effects were not depressed after extended pre-incubation of a soil sample, it seems unlikely that only the labile SOC-pool is susceptible. With repeated substrate additions, substrate mineralisation increased with time, indicating changes in the microbial community structure. In the case of catechol, the increased substrate utilisation was accompanied by subsiding negative priming effects, which in one case even became positive. Although many factors controlling priming effects still remain unclear, the study shows that some of the priming mechanisms discussed by other authors such as co-metabolism and microbial biomass turnover are insufficient to explain the observed data. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The experiments were carried out on a Gleyic Albeluvisol (ABg) in the upper part of Dniester basin, Western Ukraine. The soil samples were taken from 50-cm depth soil profile with 5-cm step. Total organic carbon (TOC), cold water extractable organic carbon (CWEOC) and hot water extractable organic carbon (HWEOC) contents in soil were determined as well as pH (H 2 O) and electrical conductivity of soil:water suspensions. The results of this study showed that in 0\textendash 50 cm layer of arable soil TOC content decreased by 32\%, CWEOC \textendash{} by 23\% and HWEOC \textendash{} by 74\% compared to forest soil that confirmed a high informative role of HWEOC fraction. The profile changes of WEOC percentage were analysed. They also show that HWEOC is much more informative indicator of soil organic matter quality than CWEOC. The most prominent changes of soil chemical properties, TOC, CWEOC and HWEOC contents in response to deforestation were observed in the top 5-cm soil layer. We suggested this thin soil layer to be defined as soil stress-sensitive zone.},

However, there are concerns about the reliability of the data generated by the various methods due to containment artifacts. We amended a sandy soil with either poultry manure, biosolids, or yard-waste compost and incubated the mixtures using four in situ methods (buried bags, covered cylinders, standard resin traps, and "new" soil-resin traps) and a conventional laboratory technique in plastic bags. Each incubation device was destructively sampled at 45-d intervals for 180 d and net N mineralization was determined by measuring the amount of inorganic N that accumulated in the soil or soil plus resin traps. Containment effects were evaluated by comparing water content of the containerized soil to a field-reference soil column. In situ incubation methods provided reasonable estimates of short-term ({$<$}45 d) N mineralization, but long-term ({$>$}45 d) mineralization data were not accurate due to a variety of problems specific to each technique. Buried bags and covered cylinders did not retain mineralized N due to water movement into and out of the containers. Neither resin method captured all of the mineralized N that leached through the soil columns, but the new soil-resin trap method tracked field soil water content better than all other in situ methods evaluated. With further refinement and validation, the new soil-resin trap method may be a useful in situ incubation technique for measuring net N mineralization rates of organic soil amendments.},

  abstract = {The extent to which SOM content and texture affect C and N dynamics during dry/wet cycles is poorly understood. A laboratory incubation study was conducted to quantify short-term changes in SOM (C \& N) fractions and their relationship to C and N mineralisation in response to dry/wet cycles along a SOM gradient in two soil types of differing texture. The experiment consisted of three phases: pre-incubation, treatment and recovery. Three soil water content (SWC) treatments were established: continuously wet (WW; field capacity (FC)), moderately dry (MD; 120\% of SWC at wilting point (WP)) and very dry (VD; 80\% of SWC at WP). Each of the two `dry' treatments were either maintained continuously dry (MD \& VD) or subjected to three sequential 20 d-long dry/wet cycles (MDW \& VDW) during the experiments treatment phase. All soils were returned to FC at the start of the recovery phase and analyses were carried out at the end of each phase. Over all, the results of this study showed that SOC content and texture are important factors affecting the size of several commonly measured fractions of soil organic matter, but the stability and resilience of these fractions depended on the duration and amplitude of dry/ wet cycles. Whereas most of the measured C and N fractions (cold water extractable C [CWEC] and hot water extractable C [HWEC], microbial biomass C [MBC] and N [MBN], inorganic N) were affected by both the duration (e.g. MDW vs. MD) and amplitude (e.g. MDW vs. VDW) of dry/wet cycles, the response differed between fractions and the effects tended to be much stronger in silt loam than in clay loam soils. The duration and amplitude of dry/wet cycles also suppressed the rate of both C and N mineralisation in both soils compared to continuously wet conditions. There was also strong evidence that the C mineralised from both soils during the recovery phase (i.e. following rewetting of dry soils) compensated for the reduction in C mineralised during the treatment phase. For N mineralisation, the amplitude of dry/ wet cycles was at least as important as the duration of the cycles in affecting N mineralisation during the recovery phase. Much higher rates of N mineralisation were observed in soils that had previously been exposed to very dry conditions, particularly in the silt loam soil. There was some evidence that HWEC was the primary source of the C made available during the rewetting of dry soil and that it contributed to the increased availability of CWEC and supported an increase in MBC and C mineralisation in both soils during the recovery phase. In contrast, there was no evidence that differences in availability of C and N fractions affected the rate of N mineralisation following the return of dry soils to continuously wet conditions. Further research is need to resolve the primary factors that regulate N mineralisation response to the recovery from dry soil conditions.},

  abstract = {Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments have demonstrated increased plant productivity in response to elevated (e)CO2, with the magnitude of responses related to soil nutrient status. Whilst understanding nutrient constraints on productivity responses to eCO2 is crucial to predicting carbon uptake and storage, very little is known about how eCO2 affects nutrient cycling in phosphorus (P)-limited ecosystems. Our study investigates eCO2 effects on soil N and P dynamics at the EucFACE experiment in Western Sydney over an 18 month period. Three ambient and three eCO2 (+150 ppm) FACE rings were installed in a P-limited, mature Cumberland Plain Eucalyptus woodland. Levels of plant accessible nutrients, evaluated using ion exchange resins, were increased under eCO2, compared to ambient, for nitrate (+93\%), ammonium (+12\%) and phosphate (+54\%). There was a strong seasonality to responses, particularly for phosphate, resulting in a relatively greater stimulation in available P, compared to N, under eCO2 in spring and summer. eCO2 was also associated with faster nutrient turnover rates in the first six months of the experiment, with higher N (+175\%) and P (+211\%) mineralisation rates compared to ambient rings, although this difference did not persist. Seasonally-dependant effects of eCO2 were seen for concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in soil solution (+31\%), and there was also a reduction in bulk-soil pH (-0.18 units) observed under eCO2. These results demonstrate that CO2 fertilisation increases nutrient availability - particularly for phosphate - in P-limited soils, likely via increased plant belowground investment in labile carbon and associated enhancement of microbial turnover of organic matter and mobilisation of chemically-bound P. Early evidence suggests that there is the potential for the observed increases in P availability to support increased ecosystem C-accumulation under future predicted CO2 concentrations.This article is protected by copyright.

Soil protective capacity is defined as the maximum amount of C associated with clay and silt ({$<$}20 {$\mu$}m) in grassland and uncultivated soils. To test this hypothesis, 14C-labeled ryegrass (grown in a phytotron and continuously labeled with 14CO2 ; specific activity 546 Bq mg-1 C) was mixed with 11 soil samples differing in texture and saturation deficit, the latter being the difference between the actual and the maximum amount of C associated with the {$<$}20-{$\mu$}m fraction. After 3 d of incubation, the percentage of applied 14C that had respired showed a significant correlation (r = -0.85) with the saturation deficit. After 53 d of incubation, the amount of 14C respired showed a significant correlation with the saturation deficit of the fine-textured soils (r = - 0.88), but not with those of coarse-textured soils. The correlation between 14CO2 production and soil texture was weak. The results confirm the hypothesis that the degree of saturation of the protective capacity of a soil predicts the decomposition rate of residue C better than does soil texture alone.},

An index of previous cropping history (number of years under pasture or arable cropping immediately prior to sampling) and the hot water-extractable carbohydrate fraction were closely correlated with aggregate stability. Total N, organic C, acid-hydrolysable and cold water-extractable carbohydrate were moderately well correlated with aggregate stability whilst HCl- and NaOH-extractable carbohydrates were poorly correlated with aggregate stability. Aggregate stability was correlated with clod porosity when arable and pasture samples were analysed separately, but not when all soils were included. In many of the typical short-term mixed cropping rotations used in the study area the total soil organic matter content remained relatively unchanged yet microbial biomass C, hot water-extractable carbohydrate and aggregate stability increased markedly during the pasture phase and declined during the arable period. It is suggested that the increase in aggregate stability during the short-term pasture is due principally to production of binding carbohydrates (which are hot water-extractable) by the large microbial biomass present in the pasture rhizosphere. When the pasture is ploughed under the microbial biomass declines as does aggregate stability. The increase in aggregate stability following pasture establishment is considerably more rapid than the increase in clod porosity. Thus, at a similar clod porosity, pasture aggregates had a higher aggregate stability than their arable counterparts. \textcopyright{} 1991.},

One experiment was conducted over one growing season (4 months) whereas the other had been conducted for three consecutive growing seasons (32 months). In the four-month experiment, aggregate stability (estimated as MWD) of soil from experimental plots followed the order Italian ryegrass {$>$} prairie grass {$>$} phacelia = pea = maize. At the 32-month site the order was perennial ryegrass {$>$} annual ryegrass {$>$} perennial white clover = barley. At both sites crops with the greatest root mass and root length density had the greatest effect on increasing MWD. In all cases, rhizosphere soil had a significantly higher microbial biomass and MWD than non-rhizosphere soil. However, organic C, total content of acid-hydrolysable carbohydrate and content of individual monosaccharides in acid hydrolysates were similar in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil. The fraction of soil carbohydrate extractable with hot water (representing about 6-8\% of the total carbohydrate content) was significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil. This fraction has a galactose plus mannose over arabinose plus xylose ratio of 2.120132.3 indicating that it was predominantly of microbial origin. It is suggested that the carbohydrate fraction extractable with hot water is made up of exocellular microbial polysaccharides that are involved in stabilizing soil aggregates in the rhizosphere. By comparison with arable crop species, grass species have a larger root mass and root length density, and therefore a higher microbial biomass and larger production of carbohydrate extractable with hot water. As a result they have a more marked effect on improving soil aggregate stability.},

  abstract = {Total soil organic matter content is a key attribute of soil quality since it has far-reaching effects on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. However, changes in contents of organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) occur only slowly and do not provide an adequate indication of important short-term changes in soil organic matter quality that may be occurring. Labile organic matter pools can be considered as fine indicators of soil quality that influence soil function in specific ways and that are much more sensitive to changes in soil management practice. Particulate organic matter consists of partially decomposed plant litter, and it acts as a substrate and center for soil microbial activity, a short-term reservoir of nutrients, a food source for soil fauna and loci for formation of water stable macroaggregates. Dissolved (soluble) organic matter consists of organic compounds present in soil solution. This pool acts as a substrate for microbial activity, a primary source of mineralizable N, sulfur (S), and phosphorus (P), and its leaching greatly influences the nutrient and organic matter content and pH of groundwater. Various extractable organic matter fractions have also been suggested to be important, including hot water-extractable and dilute acid-extractable carbohydrates, which are involved in stabilization of soil aggregates, and permanganate-oxidizable C. Measurement of potentially mineralizable C and N represents a bioassay of labile organic matter using the indigenous microbial community to release labile organic fractions of C and N. Mineralizable N is also an important indicator of the capacity of the soil to supply N for crops. It is concluded that individual labile organic matter fractions are sensitive to changes in soil management and have specific effects on soil function. Together they reflect the diverse but central effects that organic matter has on soil properties and processes. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Sustainable agriculture requires nutrient management options that lead to a profitable crop yield with relatively low nitrogen (N) losses to the environment. We studied whether the addition of contrasting organic amendments together with inorganic fertilizer can promote both requirements simultaneously. In particular we studied how the chemical composition of organic amendments affects the biomass, activity and composition of the soil microbial community and subsequently carbon (C) and N mineralization, microbial N immobilization and plant growth and nutrient uptake. In a pot experiment, Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea, cvar. Cyrus) were grown on arable soil, mixed with 15N-labelled mineral fertilizer and different kinds of organic amendments (cattle manure solid fraction, maize silage, lucerne silage, wheat straw) differing in C:N ratio and lignin content. After 69 and 132~days, destructive sampling took place to assess the effects of the different treatments on soil microbial biomass (microscopic measurements), microbial community composition (phospholipid fatty acid profiles), soil microbial activity (14C-leucine incorporation), C and N mineralization, plant biomass and 15N retrieval in soil pools, microbial biomass and plant biomass. Addition of organic amendments increased soil microbial biomass, activity and fungal/bacterial ratio and created distinct microbial community compositions, whereby high C:N ratio organic amendments had stronger effects compared to low C:N ratio amendments. Structural equation modelling showed that higher values of soil microbial activity were associated with increased N mineralization rates, increased plant biomass and plant 15N uptake, while microbial 15N immobilization was associated with soil microbial community composition. The outcomes of this study highlight the importance of the chemical composition and the amount of the organic amendments for finding a balance between plant N uptake, microbial N immobilization and N retention in labile and stable soil pools through the effects on the composition and activity of the soil microbial community. The results provide insights that can be used in designing combined input (nutrient and organic) nutrient management strategies for a more sustainable agriculture.},

This study assessed the contribution of soil fungi and bacteria to the decomposition of maize residues by means of extracted phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and 13C in specific PLFAs and investigated the importance of soil fungi in the formation of macroaggregates. Sieved soil ({$<$}250{$\mu$}m) was incubated for 28 days with and without addition of maize residues and fungicide. Our results show a significant relation between the amount of fungal PLFA 18:2{$\omega$}6 and the amount of macroaggregates. Further, the amount of macroaggregates was higher in the treatment with the higher amount of maize-derived C in fungal PLFA, suggesting that fungal activity is important for macroaggregate formation. Based on an increased incorporation of maize-derived C into actinomycetes in fungicide treatments, we suggest that actinomycetes may take over the role of soil fungi in the decomposition of SOM. Our study underpins the important role of soil fungi in the decomposition of organic matter and structure formation in the soil, and shows that during inhibition of soil fungi other soil microorganisms are promoted and adopt their function in the soil food web.},

Compost composition affects the availability of nutrients and the stability of C following the addition of compost to soil. We investigated C mineralization in a loamy sand and a loam soil amended with nine composts, two fresh manures and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay at a target rate of 10 mg total C g-1 soil. Soils were incubated at 25\textdegree C for 168 d. There was a significant interaction between amendment and soil type on C mineralization but generally, the effect of soil texture on amendment decomposition was small. The composts were very dissimilar in composition and resulted in substantial differences in the amount of C retained in the soils (2-39\% C added evolved as CO2). Total C evolved during the incubation period could be predicted from the NH4-N content and the NH4-N/NO3-N ratio of the composted manures (R2 = 0.91-0.93). Estimation of the C retained in soils amended with compost as a function of simple chemical properties of the compost provides an important tool for evaluating the effectiveness of compost as a soil amendment, helping to calculate net retention of C.},

Selection of an analytical procedure is a subjective process, because the number of suitable methods is large and each will have different merits and defects. Primary considerations are sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and absolute accuracy. Automatic methods for performing biochemical analyses, already widely accepted in hospitals and in industry, are beginning to make their way into the research laboratory. All automatic analyzers developed so far may be classified as either ``continuous-flow'' or ``discrete'' types. All of them use colorimetric methods exclusively and contain some form of automatic colorimeter for final read-out.

  abstract = {The rate of organic matter turnover in soil is a critical component of the terrestrial carbon cycle and is frequently estimated from measurements of respiration. For estimates to be reliable requires that isotopically labelled substrate uptake into the soil microbial biomass and its subsequent mineralization occurs almost simultaneously (i.e. no time delay). Here we investigated this paradigm using glucose added to an agricultural soil. Immediately after collection from the field, various concentrations of 14C-labeled glucose (1{$\mu$}M to 10mM) were added to soil and the depletion from the soil solution measured at 1\textendash 60min after substrate addition. 14CO2 production from the mineralization of glucose was simultaneously measured. The microbial uptake of glucose from soil solution was concentration-dependent and kinetic analysis suggests the operation of at least two distinct glucose transport systems of differing affinity. At glucose concentrations reflecting those naturally present in the soil solution (54{$\pm$}10{$\mu$}M), the half-time (t1/2) of exogenous glucose was extremely rapid at ca. 30s. At higher glucose concentrations (100{$\mu$}M to 10mM), the t1/2 values for the high-affinity carrier were altered little, but increasing proportions of glucose were taken up by the low affinity transport system. Glucose mineralization by the soil microbial community showed a significant delay after its uptake into the microbial biomass suggesting a decoupling of glucose uptake and subsequent respiration, possibly by dilution of glucose in labile metabolite pools. By fitting a double first order kinetic equation to the mineralization results we estimated the t1/2 for the first rapid phase of respiration at natural soil solution glucose concentrations to be 6\textendash 8min, but at least 87\% of the added glucose was retained in the microbial biomass prior to mineralization. Our results suggest that in this soil the soil solution glucose pool turns over 100\textendash 1000 times each day, an order of magnitude faster than when determined from measurements of mineralization. These results imply that traditional isotopic based measurements of substrate turnover measured using CO2 may vastly underestimate their rate of cycling in soil.},

We conducted a 3-year litterbag experiment and measured hydrolyzable amino acids (AA) and amino sugars (AS) to gain insights about microbial contributions to the chemical characteristics of decomposing litter and soil. Microscopic observations of hyphae were used to estimate fungal contributions to litter. The carbon (C)-normalized yields of AA and AS increased during decomposition along with nitrogen (N), indicating a shift in chemical characteristics from C-rich plant-derived biopolymers to N-rich, microbially-derived biochemicals. The contributions of fungal biomass to C and N were minor, but necromass of fungi as melanized and clamp-bearing hyphae increased during litter decomposition. Yields of glucosamine and galactosamine in litter approached those in microorganisms, particularly bacteria, suggesting major contributions of bacterial residues to litter during decomposition. The microbial contributions to decomposing litter were consistent with those observed in organic and mineral soils. Microorganisms play important roles in the organization and stabilization of soil organic matter as well as N immobilization and organic C preservation. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Although the soil properties have diverged as a result of the experimental treatments since 1897, the soil organic carbon (SOC) contents of the plots have remained largely unchanged between the 1980s and 2006. In this study we have determined the effects of contrasting manure and fertilizer treatments on the total N contents of the soil, the recalcitrance of soil organic matter, the contributions made from different depths to the overall C mineralization, and the distribution of soil microbial biomass in the soil profiles. Relative to the control plot, which has received no manure or fertilizer additions since 1897, the two plots that have received manure or P plus K contain significantly more N, which in the case of the P plus K plot is consistent with abundant Trifolium spp. in the sward. The plot that has received farmyard manure (FYM) contained 11\% more N than the control. The two plots that received large inputs of (NH4)2SO4 and which have consequently become highly acidic (around pH 4) contain 15\textendash 27\% less N than the control despite the N addition and the accumulation of SOC in these plots. The plot that has only received P has also apparently lost total N (20\%) relative to the control. The rates of C mineralization of the microbial biomass were closely related to total SOC contents but have been positively influenced by the increased N in the P plus K plot. Values for soil N, C mineralization rate and microbial C are reported because such data from sites that have been under known long-term known land-use are extremely rare and because there is increasing realization of the potential importance of soil data, especially biological characteristics, for monitoring environmental changes.},

  abstract = {Addition of soluble organic substrates to soil has been shown to either increase or restrict the rate of microbial CO2-C evolution. This has been attributed to a priming effect resulting from accelerated or decreased turnover of the soil organic matter including the soil microflora. We investigated microbial responses to small glucose-C additions (10-50 mu g C g(1) soil) in arable soils either amended or not with cellulose. An immediate CO2-C release between 0 and 69 h (equivalent to 59\% of glucose-C applied) was measured. However, only half of the CO2-C respired could be attributed to the utilisation of glucose-C substrate, based on the percentage of C-14-CO2 evolved after the addition of a C-14-labelled glucose tracer. Thus, although no evidence of an immediate release of 'extra' C above the rate applied as glucose-C was observed, the pattern of decomposition for C-14-glucose suggested utilisation of an alternate C source. Based on this, a positive priming effect (1.5 to 4.3 times the amount CO2-C evolved that was attributed to glucose-C decomposition) was observed for at least 170 h in non-cellulose-amended soil and 612 h in cellulose-amended soil. Two further phases of microbial activity in cellulose-amended soils were attributed to either activation of different microbial populations or end-product inhibition of cellulase activity after glucose addition. During these subsequent phases, a negative priming effect of between 0.1 and 1.5 times was observed. Findings indicate that the response of the microbial community to small additions of soluble organic C substrate is not consistent and support the premise that microbial response varies in a yet to be predicted manner between soil type and ecosystems. We hypothesise that this is due to differences in the microbial community structure activated by the addition of organic C and the timing of soluble organic substrate addition with respect to the current dissolved organic C status of the soil.},

Results showed that application of manure combined with NPK (NPK+M) gained the highest yield and increased the stability of crop production. Application of inorganic fertilizer could sustain soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, whereas long-term application of manure alone or combined with NPK (M and NPK+M) significantly increased SOC contents compared with the unfertilized control. Manure application significantly increased the proportion of large macroaggregates ({$>$}2000\textmu m) compared with the control, while leading to a corresponding decline in the percentage of microaggregates (53\textendash 250\textmu m). Carbon storage in the intra-aggregate particulate organic matter within microaggregates (iPOM\_m) was enhanced from 9.8\% of the total SOC stock in the control to 19.7\% and 18.6\% in the M and NPK+M treatments, respectively. The shift in SOC stocks towards microaggregates is beneficial for long-term soil C sequestration. Moreover, the differences in the microaggregate protected C (i.e., iPOM\_m) accounted, on average, for 39.8\% of the differences in total SOC stocks between the control and the manure-applied treatments. Thus, we suggest that the microaggregate protected C is promising for assessing the impact of long-term fertilization management on SOC storage in the red soil.},

  abstract = {Increased interest in practical, routine evaluation of soil health has created a need for rapid and inexpensive indicators that reflect soil nitrogen (N) status. Here we propose a soil protein measurement as an indicator of a functionally relevant and sensitive pool of organic N that can be rapidly quantified in soil testing laboratories. The procedure is based on a method that was historically used to measure "glomalin," a pool putatively of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal origin. Laboratory validation experiments demonstrate that the procedure extracts proteins from a wide range of sources, not just glomalin, and that continued use of the term glomalin is inaccurate and limits the application of the method. Therefore, we propose that the pool of proteins extracted by this method can be viewed more broadly as a soil health indicator that reflects the primary pool of organically bound N in soil and thus as potentially available organic N. We provide a laboratory protocol that details autoclaving soil in a neutral sodium citrate buffer solution followed by clarification and protein quantification steps.},

  abstract = {Nondestructive imaging methods such as X-ray computed tomography (CT) yield high-resolution, three-dimensional representations of pore space and fluid distribution within porous materials. Steadily increasing computational capabilities and easier access to X-ray CT facilities have contributed to a recent surge in microporous media research with objectives ranging from theoretical aspects of fluid and interfacial dynamics at the pore scale to practical applications such as dense nonaqueous phase liquid transport and dissolution. In recent years, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to improve CT technology, microscale analysis, and fluid dynamics simulations. However, the development of adequate image segmentation methods for conversion of gray scale CT volumes into a discrete form that permits quantitative characterization of pore space features and subsequent modeling of liquid distribution and flow processes seems to lag. In this paper we investigated the applicability of various thresholding and locally adaptive segmentation techniques for industrial and synchrotron X-ray CT images of natural and artificial porous media. A comparison between directly measured and image-derived porosities clearly demonstrates that the application of different segmentation methods as well as associated operator biases yield vastly differing results. This illustrates the importance of the segmentation step for quantitative pore space analysis and fluid dynamics modeling. Only a few of the tested methods showed promise for both industrial and synchrotron tomography. Utilization of local image information such as spatial correlation as well as the application of locally adaptive techniques yielded significantly better results.

For the first time we have quantified the rate of sloughing of root cap cells in an abrasive growth medium that was compacted to create mechanical impedance to root growth. The number of maize (Zea mays) root cap cells sloughed into sand increased as a result of compaction, from 1930 to 3220 d-" per primary root. This represented a 12-fold increase in the number of cells sloughed per mm root extension (from 60 to 700). We estimated that the whole of the cap surface area was covered with detached cells in compacted sand, compared with c. 7\% of the surface area in loose sand. This lubricating layer of sloughed cells and mucilage probably decreases frictional resistance to soil penetration. The total carbon deposited by the root was estimated at c. 110 \textmu g g-" sand d-". Sloughed cells accounted for 10\% of the total carbon, the vast majority of carbon being contained in mucilage exudates.},

For both soil seres (0-{$>$}200 years) it was shown that the q CO 2 decreased with time, which corroborated the hypothesis. In addition, the short term development of the q CO 2 was demonstrated with a revegetation trial.

  abstract = {Abstract. Anthropogenic land degradation affects many biogeophysical processes, including reductions of net primary production (NPP). Degradation occurs at scales from small fields to continental and global. While measurement and monitoring of NPP in small areas is routine in some studies, for scales larger than 1 km2, and certainly global, there is no regular monitoring and certainly no attempt to measure degradation. Quantitative and repeatable techniques to assess the extent of deleterious effects and monitor changes are needed to evaluate its effects on, for example, economic yields of primary products such as crops, lumber, and forage, and as a measure of land surface properties which are currently missing from dynamic global vegetation models, assessments of carbon sequestration, and land surface models of heat, water, and carbon exchanges. This study employed the local NPP scaling (LNS) approach to identify patterns of anthropogenic degradation of NPP in the Burdekin Dry Tropics (BDT) region of Queensland, Australia, from 2000 to 2013. The method starts with land classification based on the environmental factors presumed to control (NPP) to group pixels having similar potential NPP. Then, satellite remotely sensing data were used to compare actual NPP with its potential. The difference in units of mass of carbon and percentage loss were the measure of degradation. The entire BDT (7.45 \,\texttimes\, 106 km2) was investigated at a spatial resolution of 250 \,\texttimes\, 250 m. The average annual reduction in NPP due to anthropogenic land degradation in the entire BDT was -2.14 MgC m-2 yr-1, or 17 \% of the non-degraded potential, and the total reduction was -214 MgC yr-1. Extreme average annual losses of 524.8 gC m-2 yr-1 were detected. Approximately 20 \% of the BDT was classified as ``degraded''. Varying severities and rates of degradation were found among the river basins, of which the Belyando and Suttor were highest. Interannual, negative trends in reductions of NPP occurred in 7 \% of the entire region, indicating ongoing degradation. There was evidence of areas that were in a permanently degraded condition. The findings provide strong evidence and quantitative data for reductions in NPP related to anthropogenic land degradation in the BDT.},

  abstract = {Rapidly rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 have prompted a flurry of studies on soils as potential carbon (C) `sinks'. Sequestering C in soils is often seen as a `win\textendash win' proposition; it not only removes excess CO2 from the air, but also improves soils by augmenting organic matter, an energy and nutrient source for biota. But organic matter is most useful, biologically, when it decays. So we face a dilemma: can we both conserve organic matter and profit from its decay? Or must we choose one or the other? In this essay, I contemplate the merits, first of building soil C and then of decaying (losing) it, partly from a historical perspective. I then consider the apparent trade-off between accrual and decay, and reflect on how the dilemma might be resolved or assuaged. These fledgling thoughts, offered mostly to stir more fruitful debate, include: finding ways to increase C inputs to soil; seeking to optimize the timing of decay; and understanding better, from an ecosystem perspective, the flows of C, rather than only the stocks. Carbon sequestration is a sound and worthy goal. But soil organic matter is far more than a potential tank for impounding excess CO2; it is a relentless flow of C atoms, through a myriad of streams\textemdash some fast, some slow\textemdash wending their way through the ecosystem, driving biotic processes along the way. Now, when we aim to regain some of the C lost, we may need new ways of thinking about soil C dynamics, and tuning them for the services expected of our ecosystems. This objective, perhaps demanding more biology along with other disciplines, is especially urgent when we contemplate the stresses soon to be imposed by coming global changes.},

We used data from a chronosequence of tallgrass prairie restorations and a path analysis approach to evaluate how the lengths of two dia size classes of fibrous roots, the length of external mycorrhizal hyphae, microbial biomass C, hot-water soluble carbohydrate C and soil organic C interact to promote the stabilization of soil aggregates. The measured binding agents accounted for 88\% of the variation in macroaggregates {$>$}212 {$\mu$}m diameter and goodness-of-fit indexes indicated a good practical fit of the path model to the data. The restoration of macroaggregate structure in this system was apparently driven by the direct and indirect effects of roots and external hyphae, with lesser relative contributions by the three measured C pools. Although the two root size classes had similar direct effects on the percentage of macroaggregates, their indirect contributions differed substantially. Fine roots (0.2-1 mm diameter) exerted considerable indirect effects via their strong influences on external hyphae and microbial biomass C. Very fine roots ({$<$} 0.2 mm dia) made a stronger contribution to soil organic C than fine roots, but their overall indirect contribution to aggregation was minimal. In addition, the relative importance of each binding agent varied for different size fractions of macroaggregates and generally supported the hypothesis that the effectiveness of various binding mechanisms depends on the physical dimensions of the binding agents relative to the spatial scales of the aggregate planes of weakness being bridged.},

  abstract = {In addition to increasing plant C inputs, strategies for enhancing soil C sequestration include reducing C turnover and increasing its residence time in soils. Two major mechanisms, (bio)chemical alteration and physicochemical protection, stabilize soil organic C (SOC) and thereby control its turnover. With (bio)chemical alteration, SOC is transformed by biotic and abiotic processes to chemical forms that are more resistant to decomposition and, in some cases, more easily retained by sorption to soil solids. With physicochemical protection, biochemical attack of SOC is inhibited by organomineral interactions at molecular to millimeter scales. Stabilization of otherwise decomposable SOC can occur via sorption to mineral and organic soil surfaces, occlusion within aggregates, and deposition in pores or other locations inaccessible to decomposers and extracellular enzymes. Soil structure is a master integrating variable that both controls and indicates the SOC stabilization status of a soil. One potential option for reducing SOC turnover and enhancing sequestration, is to modify the soil physicochemical environment to favor the activities of fungi. Specific practices that could accomplish this include manipulating the quality of plant C inputs, planting perennial species, minimizing tillage and other disturbances, maintaining a near-neutral soil pH and adequate amounts of exchangeable base cations (particularly calcium), ensuring adequate drainage, and minimizing erosion. In some soils, amendment with micro- and mesoporous sorbents that have a high specific surface \textendash{} such as fly ash or charcoal \textendash{} can be beneficial.},

After five years of continuous CSA based experiment, a two years study was conducted to evaluate changes in microbial biomasses (microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen), enzyme activities (alkaline phosphatase, dehydrogenase and {$\beta$}-glucosidase), nutrient release and uptake (N, P and K) at different wheat crop growth stages. Effect of CSA practices was also studied for carbon mineralization in an incubation experiment. Four scenarios (Sc) were included in this study- conventional tillage (CT) based rice-wheat system (Sc1), partial CSA based rice-wheat-mungbean system (Sc2), full CSA based rice-wheat-mungbean system (Sc3), and full CSA based maize-wheat-mungbean system (Sc4). Soil samples were collected from scenarios at 0\textendash 15 and 15-30 cm depth at different growth stages of wheat crop namely sowing, crown root initiation (CRI), active tillering, panicle initiation, and harvesting. Analysis of soil was done for chemical properties viz. pH, electrical conductivity, available N, P, K, NPK uptake and mineralizable carbon and biological properties viz., microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), dehydrogenase activity (DHA), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) and {$\beta$}-glucosidase. Significantly higher microbial biomass carbon (42 \%) and nitrogen (79 \%) were found in surface soil (0-15 cm depth) under CSA based scenarios (Sc2, Sc3 and Sc4) at harvest stage of wheat over CT based/ conventional scenario (Sc1). At surface soil, alkaline phosphatase, dehydrogenase and {$\beta$}-glucosidase activity was 58, 14 and 13 \% higher in CSA based scenarios, respectively than CT based scenario. CSA based scenarios showed significantly higher C mineralization after 3 days of the incubation experiment at harvest. An increase of respectively 15, 48 and 17 \% of N, P and K uptake was observed with CSA based scenarios than CT based scenario. At harvest stage, 7 \% higher amount of dry matter was reported with full CSA based scenarios (mean of Sc2 to Sc4) compared to Sc1. Higher wheat grain yield of {$\sim$}10 \% was recorded with CSA based scenarios over CT based scenario. Therefore, CSA based scenarios with improved biological properties and nutrient availability and uptake at different wheat growth stages resulted in higher yields and hence need to be popularized among the farmers.},

This was measured for a range of organisms: two yeasts Succharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis), two fungi (Cylindrocarpon sp. and Penicillium chrysogenum), an actinomycete (Streptomyces clavuligerus), seven bacteria (Aerobacter aerogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium histolyticum, Escherichia coli, Microccus lysodeikticus, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Nitrosomonas europaea) and a soil invertebrate (Lumbricus terrestris). The organisms were mixed with soil and fumigated; the consumption of O2, evolution of CO2 and mineralization of N were then measured under the standard conditions used to measure the flush. Control values obtained with fumigated soil alone were deducted, assuming that the added organisms did not cause a priming action. Taking all the organisms together, 50??0 ?? 8??2\% of the C originally present was mineralized in the 10 days following fumigation, giving a mean value of 0??5 for k. Experiments with earthworms showed that fumigation with CHCl3 did not appreciably increase the amounts of C and N mineralized from organisms that were already dead and that k was independent of the amount of organism added. From a consideration of the results in this and in the preceding three papers, it is concluded that the flush following fumigation can be used to give a rough measure of the amount of biomass in a soil. ?? 1976.},

Sixty-six soils were investigated for the first time and the data on a further 87 soils were obtained from the literature. The single kEC values ranged from 0.23 to 0.84. A split according to the form of land use resulted in a significantly (Scheff\'e, P = 0.05) lower kEC value for the arable soils (0.42; n = 94) in comparison to those for the grassland (0.49; n = 46) and the forest soils (0.51; n = 13). This difference is mainly due to the significant effects of the respiration rate measured in non-fumigated control samples of the FI method which was used for calibration of the kEC value. For that reason, I investigated the effects of incubation temperature (22\textdegree, 25\textdegree{} and 28\textdegree C) on biomass C data obtained by the FI method, and thus on the kEC value of the FE method, and discuss further problems of direct and indirect calibration. Based on experimental and literature data, I conclude that the kEC values of Vance et al. (Soil Biology \& Biochemistry19, 703\textendash 707, 1987) and Wu et al. (Soil Biology \& Biochemistry22, 1167\textendash 1169, 1990) remain valid.

The ECHC-to-EC ratio was mainly affected by the pH but also by soil organic C and total N, but not directly by the form of land use. Due to the large, pH-dependent variations in the ECHC-to-EC ratio, no conversion factor can be proposed for the estimation of biomass C by measuring carbohydrate C.

Four different main approaches for quantifying the fungal and bacterial contribution to microbial tissue can be distinguished: (1) microscopic methods, (2) selective inhibition, (3) specific cell membrane components and (4) specific cell wall components. In this review, the different methods were compared and we hypothesized that all these approaches result in similar values for the fungal and bacterial contribution to total microbial biomass, activity, and residues (dead microbial tissue) if these methods are evenly reliable for the estimation of fungal biomass. The fungal contribution to the microbial biomass or respiration varied widely between 2 and 95\% in different data sets published over the past three decades. However, the majority of the literature data indicated that fungi dominated microbial biomass, respiration or non-biomass microbial residues, with mean percentages obtained by the different methodological approaches varying between 35 and 76\% in different soil groups, i.e. arable, grassland, and forest soils and litter layers. Microscopic methods generally gave the lowest average values, especially in arable and grasslands soils. Very low ratios in fungal biomass C-to-ergosterol obtained by microscopic methods suggest a severe underestimation of fungal biomass by certain stains. Relatively consistent ratios of ergosterol to linoleic acid (18:2??6,9) indicate that both cell membrane components are useful indicators for saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi. More quantitative information on the PLFA content of soil bacteria and the 16:1??5 content of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is urgently required to fully exploit the great potential of PLFA measurements. The most consistent results have been obtained from the analysis of fungal glucosamine and bacterial muramic acid in microbial residues. Component-specific ??13C analyses of PLFA and amino sugars are a promising prospect for the near future. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The microbial biomass carbon-to-nitrogen ratio showed a negative relationship with the AEC and strong positive relationships with the ratios ergosterol-to-microbial biomass C, ergosterol-to-ATP and fungal C-to-bacterial C. In conclusion, the long-term application of farmyard manure in combination with organic farming practices led to an increased accumulation of bacterial residues.},

  abstract = {Abstract The current review investigates the hypothesis that dormant soil microorganisms are relevant for microbial processes and community changes. Dormant soil microorganisms are C limited and do not grow. However, they still have a basic metabolism, which requires organic C uptake, resulting in a slow biomass turnover. Dormant soil microorganisms respond to substrate limitation by recycling own cell components and by down-regulating enzyme-expressing genes. The adsorption of microbial cells to clay and soil organic matter, intensified by limited water availability under unsaturated conditions, reduces microbial requirements for maintenance energy but causes immobility. For this reason, soil microorganisms cannot move rapidly towards places of demand for a certain microbial ability. Consequently, it can be assumed that subsoils and deeper vadose zone sediments must have been predominantly colonized by microorganisms during periods near to the surface, with access to autotrophic C inputs. Being remote from hotspots of C input, dormant microorganisms are an important reservoir of biodiversity and potential activity if an organic substrate arrives. The turnover of the whole microbial biomass C (MBC) is the product of C use efficiency (CUE) and a maintenance coefficient. For complex osmotrophic soil microbial communities, the CUE accounts for all biomass and metabolites synthesized during growth, i.e. especially exo-enzymes but also extracellular polymeric substances. This results in a mean CUE of 0.59 for easily soluble glucose and sucrose components and a mean CUE of 0.45 for more complex organic polymers such as cellulose, straw and MBC. The annual C input limits the MBC turnover time, which varies roughly around 365 days, assuming a CUE of 0.4 for soil organic matter.},

On average, soil C turnover was twice as fast in tropical com- pared with temperate regions, but no major differences were observed in SOM quality between the two regions. Probably due to the soil mineralogy dominated by 1:1 clay minerals and oxides in tropical regions, we found a higher aggregate stability, but a lower correlation between C contents and aggregate stability in tropical soils.

To evaluate the impacts of this change on soil organic matter properties, we compared total organic C and neutral and amino sugars content in whole soil and particle size separates of two forested, and five related sites that had been either clear-cut for 12 and 18 mo, or cultivated to maize for 4-22 yr. Soil carbohydrates accounted for 4-7\% of the total organic C across all sites. Soil organic C contents of clear-cut and cultivated sites were only 57-79\% of the average value measured in forested sites. Accordingly, carbohydrate content of clear-cut and cultivated sites were only 35-66\% of the value in forested sites. Ordering the sites in a chronosequence indicated that both total organic C and carbohydrate contents decreased with an increase in time elapsed since clear-cutting and maize cultivation. The only exception was a partial recovery of carbohydrate content in the site that had been under continuous maize for 22 yr. The clay+silt fraction (0-50 {$\mu$}m) was enriched in carbohydrates, mainly of microbial origin, whereas the sand size fractions (50-200 and 200-2000 {$\mu$}m) contained fewer carbohydrates which were mainly of plant origin. Monosaccharide analysis of particle size separates revealed significant differences in carbohydrate composition between sites. Relative to forested sites, the coarse and fine sand fractions in clear-cut and cultivated sites were depleted in carbohydrates and were relatively enriched in plant-derived carbohydrates. Carbohydrate content of the clay+silt fraction drastically decreased upon clear-cutting. Amino sugar content was consistently lower in clear-cut and cultivated sites than in forested sites, indicating that microbial populations were negatively affected by clear-cutting and cultivation. The fungal population appeared more sensitive than bacteria to these land-use changes as indicated by a greater decline in glucosamine than in muramic acid contents. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Future thoughts 474 Acknowledgements 474 References 474 Summary The loss of carbon from roots (rhizodeposition) and the consequent proliferation of microorganisms in the surrounding soil, coupled with the physical presence of a root and processes associated with nutrient uptake, gives rise to a unique zone of soil called the rhizosphere. In this review, we bring together evidence to show that roots can directly regulate most aspects of rhizosphere C flow either by regulating the exudation process itself or by directly regulating the recapture of exudates from soil. Root exudates have been hypothesized to be involved in the enhanced mobilization and acquisition of many nutrients from soil or the external detoxification of metals. With few exceptions, there is little mechanistic evidence from soil-based systems to support these propositions. We conclude that much more integrated work in realistic systems is required to quantify the functional significance of these processes in the field. We need to further unravel the complexities of the rhizosphere in order to fully engage with key scientific ideas such as the development of sustainable agricultural systems and the response of ecosystems to climate change.},

  abstract = {Carbon use efficiency (CUE) describes the relative partitioning of carbon (C) between anabolic and catabolic processes within the soil microbial community. Further, it represents a major factor regulating the amount of C cascading through the trophic levels of the soil food web. How CUE relates to C supply, however, remains poorly understood. The primary aim of this study was to determine how CUE varies across a range of spatial scales as a function of C substrate supply. Our secondary aim was to understand how variations in substrate CUE influences the interpretation of community level physiological profiles (CLPP). Using 16 different 14C-labelled substrates (including amino acids, sugars, organic acids and amino sugars) and soils collected at the field, regional and continental scale, we measured the rate of substrate uptake and mineralization from which we calculated CUE. Across all soils (n = 114) and substrates (n = 16), the average CUE for the microbial community was 0.568 {$\pm$} 0.004 (range 0.492\textendash 0.794). While the partitioning of substrate-C within the biomass (immobilization/mineralization) over 72 h was highly conserved for some substrates (e.g. glucose), others showed a wide variability in CUE across the samples (e.g. valine). In the context of the CLPP methodology, we showed that individual sites could be statistically separated from each other, irrespective of whether the statistical analysis was based on microbial substrate uptake rate or mineralization rate. However, our results do suggest that caution is needed when ascribing observed CLPP differences to the importance of individual C pathways operating in soil due to the wide variation of CUE between substrates. In conclusion, we present new mechanistic evidence to support the paradigm that variation in ecosystem CUE may in part reflect differences in the types of C supplied to the microbial biomass.},

Here we demonstrate, based on an individual-based microbial community model, that social dynamics among microbes producing extracellular enzymes ('decomposers') and microbes exploiting the catalytic activities of others ('cheaters') regulate organic matter turnover. We show that the presence of cheaters increases nitrogen retention and organic matter build-up by downregulating the ratio of extracellular enzymes to total microbial biomass, allowing nitrogen-rich microbial necromass to accumulate. Moreover, increasing catalytic efficiencies of enzymes are outbalanced by a strong negative feedback on enzyme producers, leading to less enzymes being produced at the community level. Our results thus reveal a possible control mechanism that may buffer soil CO2 emissions in a future climate.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils plays an important role in the biogeochemistry of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, in pedogenesis, and in the transport of pollutants in soils. The aim of this review is to summarize the recent literature about controls on DOM concentrations and fluxes in soils. We focus on comparing results between laboratory and field investigations and on the differences between the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP).         Both laboratory and field studies show that litter and humus are the most important DOM sources in soils. However, it is impossible to quantify the individual contributions of each of these sources to DOM release. In addition, it is not clear how changes in the pool sizes of litter or humus may affect DOM release. High microbial activity, high fungal abundance, and any conditions that enhance mineralization all promote high DOM concentrations. However, under field conditions, hydrologic variability in soil horizons with high carbon contents may be more important than biotic controls. In subsoil horizons with low carbon contents, DOM may be adsorbed strongly to mineral surfaces, resulting in low DOM concentrations in the soil solution. There are strong indications that microbial degradation of DOM also controls the fate of DOM in the soil.         Laboratory experiments on controls of DOM dynamics have often contradicted field observations, primarily because hydrology has not been taken into account. For example, laboratory findings on the effects of plant species (conifer vs. deciduous) on DOM release from forest floors and on the effects of substrate quality (e.g.: C/N ratio) or pH on DOC concentrations were often not confirmed in field studies. The high adsorption capacity of soil clay minerals and oxides for DOM shown in laboratory studies may not control the transport of DOM in soils in the field if macropore fluxes dominate under field conditions. Laboratory findings about the biodegradability of DOM also await verification under field conditions.         Studies that include DON and DOP dynamics in addition to DOC are few. The rate of release and the fate of DOC, DON, and DOP in soils may differ to a far greater extent than previously assumed. Controls established for DOC might thus be not valid for DON and DOP.         Despite intensive research in the last decade, our knowledge of the formation and fate of DOM in soils and its response to changing environmental conditions is still fragmented and often inconsistent. Predictions at the field scale are still very uncertain, and most of the information available today is the result of studies on temperate soils and forest ecosystems. Thus, future research on controls of DOM dynamics should be extended to soils under different land uses and in other climate zones. Emphasis should also be given to: (i) the effects of soil organic matter properties on the release of DOM (ii) environmental factors controlling DOM quantity and quality (iii) the assessment of biological versus physico-chemical controls on the release and retention of DOM in soils, and (iv) the differences between DOC, DON, and DOP. Finally, if our goal is to predict DOM concentrations and fluxes in soils, future research on the controls of DOM dynamics should have a strong focus on field studies.},

In turn, biodegradation changes the properties of the remaining DOM, which may be decisive for the formation of stable organic carbon in soil. To gain information on both mechanisms and controlling factors of DOM biodegradation and the properties of biodegraded DOM, we investigated changes in the composition of 13 different DOM samples extracted from maize straw, forest floors, peats, and agricultural soils during a 90-day incubation using UV absorbance, fluorescence emission spectroscopy, FTIR-spectroscopy, 1H-NMR spectroscopy, pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectroscopy (Py-FIMS), and 13C natural abundance before and after incubation. Changes in the DOM properties were related to the extent of biodegradation determined by the release of CO2. Increasing UV absorption and humification indices deduced from fluorescence emission spectra, and increasing portions of aromatic H indicated relative enrichment of aromatic compounds during biodegradation. This enrichment significantly correlated with the amount of DOC mineralized suggesting that aromatic compounds were relatively stable and slowly mineralized. 13C depletion during the incubation of highly degradable DOM solutions indicated an enrichment of lignin-derived aromatic compounds. Py-FI mass spectra indicated increasing contents of phenols and lignin monomers at the expense of lignin dimers and alkylaromatics during incubation. This partial degradation of higher-molecular, lignin-derived DOM compounds was accompanied by relative increases in the proportions of lower-molecular degradation products and microbial metabolites. Carbohydrates, especially when abundant at high initial contents, seem to be the preferred substrate for microorganisms. However, four independent methods suggested also some microbial production of carbohydrates and peptides during DOM degradation. After incubation, the composition of highly degradable DOM samples became similar to relatively stable DOM samples with respect to aromaticity, carbohydrate content, and thermal stability. We conclude that DOM biodegradation seems to result in organic matter properties being a precondition for the formation of stable carbon. These structural changes induced by DOM biodegradation should also result in stronger DOM sorption to the soil matrix additionally affecting DOM stabilization.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is often considered the most labile portion of organic matter in soil and to be negligible with respect to the accumulation of soil C. In this short review, we present recent evidence that this view is invalid. The stability of DOM from forest floor horizons, peats, and topsoils against microbial degradation increases with advanced decomposition of the parent organic matter (OM). Aromatic compounds, deriving from lignin, likely are the most stable components of DOM while plant-derived carbohydrates seem easily degradable. Carbohydrates and N-rich compounds of microbial origin produced during the degradation of DOM can be relatively stable. Such components contribute much to DOM in the mineral subsoil. Sorption of DOM to soil minerals and (co-)precipitation with Al (and probably also with Fe), especially of the inherently stable aromatic moieties, result in distinct stabilization. In laboratory incubation experiments, the mean residence time of DOM from the Oa horizon of a Haplic Podzol increased from {$<$}30 y in solution to {$>$}90 y after sorption to a subsoil. We combined DOM fluxes and mineralization rate constants for DOM sorbed to minerals and a subsoil horizon, and (co-)precipitated with Al to estimate the potential contribution of DOM to total C in the mineral soil of a Haplic Podzol in Germany. The contribution of roots to DOM was not considered because of lack of data. The DOM-derived soil C ranges from 20 to 55 Mg ha\textendash 1 in the mineral soil, which represents 19\%\textendash 50\% of the total soil C. The variation of the estimate reflects the variation in mineralization rate constants obtained for sorbed and (co-)precipitated DOM. Nevertheless, the estimates indicate that DOM contributes significantly to the accumulation of stable OM in soil. A more precise estimation of DOM-derived C in soils requires mineralization rate constants for DOM sorbed to all relevant minerals or (co-)precipitated with Fe.

  abstract = {Strategies for mitigating soil organic carbon (SOC) losses in intensively managed agricultural systems typically draw from traditional concepts of soil organic matter formation, and thus emphasize increasing C inputs, especially from slowly decomposing crop residues, and reducing soil disturbance. However these approaches are often ineffective and do not adequately reflect current views of SOC cycling, which stress the important contributions of microbial biomass (MB) inputs to SOC. We examined microbial physiology as an alternate mechanism of SOC accumulation under organic (ORG) compared to conventional (CT) agricultural management practices, where ORG is accumulating C despite fewer total C inputs and greater soil tillage. We hypothesized that microbial communities in ORG have higher growth rates (MGR) and C use efficiencies (CUE) and that this relates to greater MB production and ultimately higher retention of new C inputs. We show that ORG had 50\% higher CUE ({$\pm$}8 se) and 56\% higher MGR ({$\pm$}22 se) relative to CT (p {$<$} 0.05). From in situ 13C substrate additions, we show that higher CUE and MGR are associated with greater rates and amounts of 13C glucose and phenol assimilation into MBC and mineral-associated SOC pools in ORG up to 6 mo after field substrate additions (p {$<$} 0.05). ORG soils were also enriched in proteins and lipids and had lower abundances of aromatic compounds and plant lipids (p {$<$} 0.05). These results illustrate a new mechanism for SOC accumulation under reduced C inputs and intensive soil disturbance and demonstrate that agricultural systems that facilitate the transformation of plant C into MB may be an effective, often overlooked strategy for building SOC in agricultural soils.},

Consensus is emerging that microbial materials are an important constituent of stable SOM, and new conceptual and quantitative SOM models are rapidly incorporating this view. However, direct evidence demonstrating that microbial residues account for the chemistry, stability and abundance of SOM is still lacking. Further, emerging models emphasize the stabilization of microbial-derived SOM by abiotic mechanisms, while the effects of microbial physiology on microbial residue production remain unclear. Here we provide the first direct evidence that soil microbes produce chemically diverse, stable SOM. We show that SOM accumulation is driven by distinct microbial communities more so than clay mineralogy, where microbial-derived SOM accumulation is greatest in soils with higher fungal abundances and more efficient microbial biomass production.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n\textbackslash r\textbackslash n},

  abstract = {Agricultural systems are increasingly managed for improving soil carbon (C) accumulation. However, there are limits to C returns in agricultural systems that constrain soil C accumulation capacity. Increasing the efficiency of how soil microbes process C is gaining interest as an important management strategy for increasing soil C and is a key feature of soil C dynamics in many new microbial-explicit models. A higher microbial C use efficiency (CUE) may increase C storage while reducing C system losses and is a fundamental trait affecting community assembly dynamics and nutrient cycling. However, the numerous ecological unknowns influencing CUE limit our ability to effectively manage CUE in agricultural soils for greater soil C storage. In this perspective, we consider three complex drivers of agroecosystem CUE that need to be resolved to develop effective C sequestration management practices in the future: (1) the environment as an individual trait moderator versus a filter, (2) microbial community competitive and faciliatory interactions, and (3) spatiotemporal dynamics through the soil profile and across the microbial lifecycle. We highlight ways that amendments, crop rotations, and tillage practices might affect microbial CUE conditions and the variable outcomes of these practices. We argue that to resolve some of the unknowns of CUE dynamics, we need to include more mechanistic, trait-based approaches that capitalize on advanced methods and innovative field research designs within an agroecosystem-specific context. By identifying the management-level determinants of CUE expression, we will be better positioned to optimize CUE to increase soil C storage in agricultural systems.},

Soil degradation is a global problem caused by many factors including excessive tillage, inappropriate crop rotations, excessive grazing or crop residue removal, deforestation, mining, construction and urban sprawl. To meet the needs of an expanding global population, it is essential for humankind to recognize and understand that improving soil health by adopting sustainable agricultural and land management practices is the best solution for mitigating and reversing current soil degradation trends. This research editorial is intended to provide an overview for this Special Issue of Sustainability that examines the global problem of soil degradation through reviews and recent research studies addressing soil health in Africa, Australia, China, Europe, India, North and South America, and Russia. Two common factors-soil erosion and depletion of soil organic matter (SOM)-emerge as consistent indicators of how "the thin layer covering the planet that stands between us and starvation" is being degraded. Soil degradation is not a new problem but failing to acknowledge, mitigate, and remediate the multiple factors leading to it is no longer a viable option for humankind. We optimistically conclude that the most promising strategies to mitigate soil degradation are to select appropriate land uses and improve soil management practices so that SOM is increased, soil biology is enhanced, and all forms of erosion are reduced. Collectively, these actions will enable humankind to "take care of the soil so it can take care of us".},

The experiment was conducted on a clay soil in western Sweden, in a randomised block design with four replicates. The crops grown were spring barley and oats. Changes in SOC mass were estimated by the 'equivalent soil mass' concept. Carbon inputs from crops were calculated from grain yields using linear allometric functions. The decomposition rate of soil organic matter was derived from a bare fallow treatment. Humification coefficients, defined here as the fraction of C input entering the SOC pool, for the organic amendments and crop residues were estimated by fitting a single-pool first order model to the final SOC stocks. The humification coefficient was highest for domestic waste compost (0.9) and lowest for above-ground crop residues (0.19). Crop yields were highest in sewage sludge-amended soil, probably due to favourable physical soil conditions, as indicated by lower bulk density (1.27-1.30gcm-3) than in the other treatments (1.32-1.38gcm-3). Despite addition of relatively high amounts of organic N, yields in other treatments receiving organic amendments were significantly lower than in those receiving mineral N fertiliser. In particular, the compost material was found to be highly recalcitrant, as indicated by its low C/N ratio (10) and low crop yield. Comparison of the correlation between phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentration and SOC showed that compost supported relatively less microbial biomass than the other substrates tested. An important finding was that differences in SOC between treatments were significant to 40cm depth and that up to 27\% of the SOC changes observed to 40cm depth occurred in the upper subsoil (25-40cm). Thus, SOC changes below ploughing depth should be considered in SOC balance studies. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The soil microbial biomass is surrounded by about 50 times its mass of soil organic matter, but can only metabolize it very slowly. Paradoxically, even if more than 90\% of the soil microbial biomass is killed, the mineralization of soil organic matter proceeds at the same rate as in an unperturbed soil. Here we show that soil organic matter mineralization is independent of microbial biomass size, community structure or specific activity. We suggest that the rate limiting step is governed by abiological processes (which we term the Regulatory Gate hypothesis), which convert non-bioavailable soil organic matter into bioavailable soil organic matter, and cannot be affected by the microbial population. This work challenges one of the long held theories in soil microbiology proposed by Winogradsky, of the existence of autochthonous and zymogenous microbial populations. This has significant implications for our understanding of carbon mineralization in soils and the role of soil micro-organisms in the global carbon cycle. Here we describe experiments designed to determine if the Regulatory Gate operates. We conclude that there is sufficient experimental evidence for it to be offered as a working hypothesis. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Soil samples from two contrasting treatment types of European long-term agroecosystem experiments, i.e. conventionally managed (fertilized) and C-depleted plots, enriched in refractory compounds, were compared. Bulk samples from eight experimental sites and particle-size fractions of two of the sites were investigated. The CuO oxidation technique was used as a relative measure of lignin and its degree of structural alteration. The contents and composition of polysaccharides were determined following hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). For the bulk samples, the amount of lignin phenols declined more than the total OC in the course of C-depletion. The contribution of lignin phenols to total OC was thus lower in the C-depleted versus the fertilized plots. A greater lignin biodegradation was found in the bulk samples of the depleted plots compared with the fertilized plots. The analysis of size fractions revealed lower OC-normalized contents of lignin phenols and a higher degree of lignin alteration in fractions , 63 mm of the depleted versus the fertilized plots. These findings indicate that lignin does not accumulate within the refractory C pool of arable soils. The refractory SOC pool shows a lower contribution of lignin as compared with more labile fractions of SOC. If lignin-derived carbon is present in the stable pool it has been extensively modified so that it can no longer be identified as phenolic CuO oxidation products. OC-normalized contents of polysaccharides (neutral sugars and galacturonic acid) were similar in bulk samples of the C-depleted and fertilized plots. The contrasting treatments showed similar polysaccharide contents especially in separates ,6 mm. The separates ,6 mm in the C-depleted plots retained between 50 and 100\% of the polysaccharide amounts in the fertilized plots. The mass ratio of (galactose \th{} mannose)-to-(arabinose \th{} xylose) (GM/AX) was higher in bulk samples of the C-depleted versus the fertilized plots, indicating a higher relative contribution of microbial sugars. Within a particular soil, the fine separates were those with the highest GM/AX ratio. These results indicate that the refractory C pool has a similar proportion of polysaccharides as the labile C pool, but refractory polysaccharides are mainly associated with fine separates and show a dominant contribution of microbial sugars. Our results provide evidence that polysaccharides, mainly those of microbial origin, are stabilized over the long-term within fine separates of arable soils. In contrast, CuO lignin is associated mainly with the coarse fractions and does not contribute to the refractory C pool.},

In order to study the microbial community structure of aggregates, polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) was performed using 16S rRNA genes. The PCR-DGGE of the Bacteria Actinomycetes and Archaea showed divergent results between the different aggregate fractions. The results showed that the bacterial community structure was highly similar between bulk soil and clay; the inner aggregate community structure of Actinomycetes was closely related between coarse and fine sand and coarse silt, and the Archaea community structure of outer and inner aggregates was more similar than that of total bacteria or Actinomycetes.},

In the future we need to be more vigilant in managing and renewing this precious resource by replacing the nutrients and life-sustaining matter that we remove for our own needs. Taking these issues into consideration, Soil Carbon Management: Economic, Environmental, and Societal Benefits explores all of the advantages of effective soil carbon (C) management. A Different Way of Examining Soil C Management This unique resource provides a new conceptual framework to develop policies for managing and enhancing soil C and presents new approaches to achieve positive environmental outcomes. In each chapter, the book poses a problem or set of problems and then describes how effective soil C management can help to solve these challenges, listing the multiple benefits that arise from these practices. The book addresses specific problems such as soil erosion and land degradation and evaluates the advantages of soil C sequestration, specifically for policy development purposes. The policies discussed can be tailored to meet regional and local needs and constraints. The book also explains how to achieve an ideal environment by applying beneficial practices for farming and land management. A Plan for the Future Illustrating how to conserve and preserve soil quality for future generations and detailing how to restore the ecological functions of soil, this book will aid in the formulation of future agricultural policies that sustain food and fuel needs and have long-lasting, positive environmental impacts.},

A laboratory mineralization experiment was conducted over 374 days to evaluate the effect of pre-existing SOM on soil C mineralization after addition of organic matter (OM) using sugar cane. The SOM gradient used here stretched from 21 to 106~g~C~kg-1 soil and was a result of different periods of continuous cultivation of 5, 20, 35 and 105 years in comparison to a forest soil. The rate of organic C mineralization was found to be dependent on the status of pre-existing soil organic C (SOC). Highly degraded soil which had been under continuous cultivation for 35 years and more showed the highest rate of C mineralization per unit SOC (117.9~mg~C~g-1~C) while forest soil had the lowest amount of C mineralized per unit SOC (73.5~mg~C~g-1~C). Forest soil had the highest amount of increased C mineralization as a result of organic matter (OM) additions (8.0~mg~C~g-1 soil) followed by the highly degraded soil that had been under cultivation for 105 years (5.5~mg~C~g-1 soil). Additional mineralized C as a function of time after forest conversion declined progressively within the first 20 years of continuous soil use. Soil which had been under continuous cultivation for 20 years had the lowest amount of additional mineralized C (4.0~mg~C~g-1 soil). SOM stabilization efficiency in the studied soils appears to be highest with intermediate cultivation history of about 20 years. These soils that have been recently converted to cultivation also appear to have a greater ability to stabilize added OM than the most degraded soils investigated in this study. It is thus advisable to provide intervention strategies to reverse SOM decline for farming communities at an intermediate stage before the soils are highly depleted of SOC. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {More diverse crop rotations have been promoted for their potential to remediate the range of ecosystem services compromised by biologically simplified grain-based agroecosystems, including increasing soil organic carbon (SOC). We hypothesized that functional diversity offers a more predictive means of characterizing the impact of crop rotations on SOC concentrations than species diversity per se. Furthermore, we hypothesized that functional diversity can either increase or decrease SOC depending on its associated carbon (C) input to soil. We compiled a database of 27 cropping system sites and 169 cropping systems, recorded the species and functional diversity of crop rotations, SOC concentrations (g C kg/soil), nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications (kg N{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1), and estimated C input to soil (Mg C{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1). We categorized crop rotations into three broad categories: grain-only rotations, grain rotations with cover crops, and grain rotations with perennial crops. We divided the grain-only rotations into two sub-categories: cereal-only rotations and those that included both cereals and a legume grain. We compared changes in SOC and C input using mean effect sizes and 95\% bootstrapped confidence intervals. Cover cropped and perennial cropped rotations, relative to grain-only rotations, increased C input by 42\% and 23\% and SOC concentrations by 6.3\% and 12.5\%, respectively. Within grain-only rotations, cereal + legume grain rotations decreased total C input (-16\%), root C input (-12\%), and SOC (-5.3\%) relative to cereal-only rotations. We found no effect of species diversity on SOC within grain-only rotations. N fertilizer rates mediated the effect of functional diversity on SOC within grain-only crop rotations: at low N fertilizer rates ({$\leq$}75 kg N{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1), the decrease in SOC with cereal + legume grain rotations was less than at high N fertilizer rates. Our results show that increasing the functional diversity of crop rotations is more likely to increase SOC concentrations if it is accompanied by an increase in C input. Functionally diverse perennial and cover cropped rotations increased both C input and SOC concentrations, potentially by exploiting niches in time that would otherwise be unproductive, that is, increasing the "perenniality" of crop rotations.},

  abstract = {The chapter discusses the role of actinomycetes in lignocelluloses breakdown, and the details of the scale and method by which such breakdown takes place are limited. However, there is a wide range of examples where streptomyces and other actinomycetes have been identified as degrading lignin or lignocelluloses. The enzymes involved in lignocelluloses breakdown by the actinomycetes and the thermophilic actinomycetes in particular, still remain elusive. The chapter describes the various approaches, such as selective isolation of thermophilic lignin degrading actinomycetes, screening enzymatic assay methods for the identification of lignin-degrading actinomycetes, comparison of the various lignin-degrading enzymes from mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes, molecular analysis of potential candidate genes for lignin-degrading enzymes, and bioinformatics approach to identification of potential lignin degrading genes, available to find lignin degradation genes and identified a series of candidate genes. The major reasons for the difficulty in identifying these genes and pathways were also presented in this chapter. It is clear that a systematic approach in terms of complete and well annotated genome sequencing of thermophilic Actinomycetes that can be easily genetically manipulated, followed by in-depth investigation of candidate genes, is probably the best approach to understanding lignin degradation in this useful group of microorganisms.},

  abstract = {Soils are the largest reservoir of global terrestrial carbon (C). Conversion from natural to agricultural ecosystems has generally resulted in a significant loss of soil organic-C (SOC, up to 50\% or \textasciitilde 30-40tha-1) and 'restoring' this lost C is a significant global challenge. The most stable component of soil organic matter (SOM), hereafter referred to as fine fraction SOM (FF-SOM), contains not only C, hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O), but substantial amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S), in approximately constant ratios. The availability of these associated nutrients is essential for the formation of FF-SOM. Here we show, in short term (56 day) incubation experiments with 13C labelled wheaten straw added to four soils with differing clay content, that conversion of straw into "new" FF-SOM is increased by up to three-fold by augmenting the residues with supplementary nutrients. We also show that the loss of "old" pre-existing FF-SOM increased with straw addition, compared to soils with no straw addition, but that this loss was ameliorated by nutrient addition in two of our soils. This finding may illuminate why the build-up of SOC in some productive agricultural soils is often much less than expected from the amounts of C-rich residues returned to them because optimum C sequestration requires additional nutrients above that required for crop production alone. Moreover, it provides greater understanding of short-term dynamics of C turnover in soil, and in the longer term, may have important implications for global strategies aimed at increasing soil C sequestration to restore fertility and help mitigate climate change. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Soil carbon turnover models generally divide soil carbon into pools with varying intrinsic decomposition rates. Although these decomposition rates are modified by factors such as temperature, texture, and moisture, they are rationalized by assuming chemical structure is a primary controller of decomposition. In the current work, we use near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy in combination with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and alkaline cupric oxide (CuO) oxidation to explore this assumption. Specifically, we examined material from the 2.3\textendash 2.6 kg L-1 density fraction of three soils of different type (Oxisol, Alfisol, Inceptisol). The density fraction with the youngest 14C age (Oxisol, 107 years) showed the highest relative abundance of aromatic groups and the lowest O-alkyl C/aromatic C ratio as determined by NEXAFS. Conversely, the fraction with the oldest C (Inceptisol, 680 years) had the lowest relative abundance of aromatic groups and highest O-alkyl C/aromatic C ratio. This sample also had the highest proportion of thermally labile materials as measured by DSC, and the highest ratio of substituted fatty acids to lignin phenols as indicated by CuO oxidation. Therefore, the organic matter of the Inceptisol sample, with a 14C age associated with `passive' pools of carbon (680 years), had the largest proportion of easily metabolizable organic molecules with low thermodynamic stability, whereas the organic matter of the much younger Oxisol sample (107 years) had the highest proportion of supposedly stable organic structures considered more difficult to metabolize. Our results demonstrate that C age is not necessarily related to molecular structure or thermodynamic stability, and we suggest that soil carbon models would benefit from viewing turnover rate as codetermined by the interaction between substrates, microbial actors, and abiotic driving variables. Furthermore, assuming that old carbon is composed of complex or `recalcitrant' compounds will erroneously attribute a greater temperature sensitivity to those materials than they may actually possess.},

  abstract = {The filamentous fungi have dynamic and variable hyphal structures within which cytoplasm can be moved, syn-thesized, and degraded, in response to changes in envi-ronmental conditions, resource availability, and resource distribution. Their study has gone through several phases. In the first phase, direct observation was emphasized without undue concern for interior structures or in the presence of cytoplasm. By the mid-1970s, single bio-chemical proxies (ergosterol, marker fatty acids, chitin derivatives, etc.) were being used increasingly. The use of these surrogate single measurements continues, in spite of their inability to provide information on the physical structure of the filamentous fungi. Molecular approaches also are being used, primarily through the use of bulk nucleic acid extraction and cloning. Because the sources of the nucleic acids used in such studies usually are not known, taxonomic and phylogenetic information derived by this approach cannot be linked to specific fungal structures. Recently, a greater emphasis has been placed on assessing physical aspects of indeterminate fungal growth, involving the assessment of cytoplasm-filled and evacuated (empty) hyphae. Both of these parameters are important for describing filamentous fungal growth and function. The use of phase contrast microscopy and varied general stains, as well as fluorogenic substrates with observation by epifluorescence microscopy, has made it possible to provide estimates of cytoplasm-filled hyphal lengths. Using this approach, it has been possible to evaluate the responses of the indeterminate fungal community to changes in environmental conditions, in-cluding soil management. It is now possible to obtain molecular information from individual bacteria and fungal structures (hyphae, spores, fruiting bodies) re-covered from environments, making it possible to link individual fungal structures with their taxonomic and phylogenetic information. In addition, this information can be considered in the context of the indeterminate filamentous fungal lifestyle, involving the dynamics of resource allocation to hyphal structural development and synthesis of cytoplasm. Use of this approach should make it possible to gain a greater appreciation of the indeter-minate filamentous fungal lifestyle, particularly in the context of microbial ecology.},

Inorganic fertilizer application alters root biomass and quality and therefore changes the input and turnover of soil organic matter. Little is known about how intensification of N fertilization affects C and N mineralization processes and thus contributes to N losses and C emissions. It remains unclear if N fertilizer addition positively or negatively affects soil microbial biomass carbon and soil organic C stored in the short- and long-term. Our research investigated whether increased N fertilization of permanent grassland soil affects the microbial community and if this is reflected by a change in mineralization processes from soil organic matter and Lolium perenne roots. We performed an aerobic incubation experiment on samples from a field trial on permanent grassland with varying factors: fertilizer type and N level, and presence of roots. Inorganic fertilization and root presence caused a shift in microbial community structure with an increase of saprotrophic fungi, as indicated by ergosterol content and ergosterol-to-MBC ratio. However, no significant effects of organic or inorganic fertilizer application on mineralization processes and soil microbial biomass were observed, reflecting a strong resistance of the present grassland soil system. This is probably caused by the high level of microbial biomass and clay content, providing a large chemical and biological buffer capacity. Overall, our results indicate, that the microbial community and mineralisation processes are not affected by intensification of N fertilization.},

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the long-term (10 yr) role of C input in soil organic carbon \{(SOC)\} sequestration and to identify underlying mechanisms of C stabilization in soils. Carbon input and \{SOC\} sequestration, as governed by crop management strategies, were assessed across 10 Mediterranean cropping systems. Empirically derived relationships between yield and aboveground plus belowground crop biomass as well as estimates of C contributions from crop residues and manure amendments were used to quantify cumulative C inputs into each cropping system. Soil samples were separated into four aggregate size classes (\{\textbackslash textgreater\} 2000, 250-2000, 53-250, and \{\textbackslash textless\} 53 mu m) and into three soil organic matter \{(SOM)\} fractions within the large (\{\textbackslash textgreater\} 2000 mu m) and small (250-2000 mu m) macroaggregates. Aggregate stability increased linearly with both C input (r(2) = 0.75, p = 0.001) and \{SOC\} (r(2) = 0.63, p = 0.006). Across the 10 cropping systems, annual soil C sequestration rates ranged from -0.35 to 0.56 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). We found a strong linear relationship (r(2) = 0.70, p = 0.003) between \{SOC\} sequestration and cumulative C input, with a \{residue-C\} conversion to \{SOC\} rate of 7.6\%. This linear relationship suggests that these soils have not reached an upper limit of C sequestration (i.e., not C saturated). In addition, C shifted from the \{\textbackslash textless\} 53-mu m fraction in low C input systems to the large and small macroaggregates in high C input systems. A majority of the accumulation of \{SOC\} due to additional C inputs was preferentially sequestered in the microaggregates-within-small-macroaggregates \{(mM).\} Hence, the \{mM\} fraction is an ideal indicator for C sequestration potential in sustainable agroecosystems.},

Crop management factors, such as tillage intensity (Sainju et al., 2007), fertilizer applications (Lueken et al., 1962), total residue C inputs (Buyanovsky and Wagner, 1997), and the duration of resi-due management (Rasmussen and Parton, 1994), have been shown to infl uence the retention of aboveground residue C inputs in soil. Crop management can also impact belowground crop C inputs, e.g., root biomass, sloughed cells, mucilages, and exudates. For example, Allmaras et al. (2004) found that tillage increased both rhizodeposition and the fraction of soil organic C retained from root biomass and rhizodeposition in maize systems. Research on the eff ects of crop management systems, e.g., conventional vs. alternative systems, on SOM accumulation and dy-namics has become imperative for the sustainability of agroecosystems (M\"ader et al., 2002; Pimentel et al., 2005). Drinkwater et al. (1998) compared the C and N budgets of a conventionally managed maize\textendash soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] system (fertilizer N only) vs. systems that received only manure N, legume N, or both, and found that quantitative diff erences in C inputs and the N balance across the distinct agroecosystems did not account for the observed diff erences in soil C and N among the systems. A better mechanistic understanding of the interactions between crop management and SOM dynamics is necessary to optimize tradeoff s between SOM accumulation and loss and to promote long-term strategies to maximize C storage in agroecosystems.},

During the maize growing season, we traced 13C-labeled hairy vetch (Vicia dasycarpa) roots and residues into PLFAs extracted from soil microaggregates (53-250 ??m) and silt-and-clay ({$<$}53 ??m) particles. Total PLFA biomass was greatest in the organic (41.4 nmol g-1 soil) and similar between the conventional and low-input systems (31.0 and 30.1 nmol g-1 soil, respectively), with Gram-positive bacterial PLFA dominating the microbial communities in all systems. Although total PLFA-C derived from roots was over four times greater than from residues, relative distributions (mol\%) of root- and residue-derived C into the microbial communities were not different among the three cropping systems. Additionally, neither the PLFA profiles nor the amount of root- and residue-C incorporation into the PLFAs of the microaggregates were consistently different when compared with the silt-and-clay particles. More fungal PLFA-C was measured, however, in microaggregates compared with silt-and-clay. The lack of differences between the mol\% within the microbial communities of the cropping systems and between the PLFA-C in the microaggregates and the silt-and-clay may have been due to (i) insufficient differences in quality between roots and residues and/or (ii) the high N availability in these N-fertilized cropping systems that augmented the abilities of the microbial communities to process a wide range of substrate qualities. The main implications of this study are that (i) the greater short-term microbial processing of root- than residue-C can be a mechanistic explanation for the higher relative retention of root- over residue-C, but microbial community composition did not influence long-term C sequestration trends in the three cropping systems and (ii) in spite of the similarity between the microbial community profiles of the microaggregates and the silt-and-clay, more C was processed in the microaggregates by fungi, suggesting that the microaggregate is a relatively unique microenvironment for fungal activity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The effect of land use and precipitation on annual runoff and sediment loss was investigated in eight different sites along the northern Mediterranean region and the Atlantic coastline located in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece. These sites represent a variety of landscapes and are under a number of land-uses representative of the Mediterranean region, such as agricultural land with rainfed cereals, vines, olives, eucalyptus plantation or natural vegetation (shrubland). It was found that land use can greatly affect runoff and soil erosion. The greatest rates of runoff and sediment loss were measured in hilly areas under vines (average sediment loss 142.8 t km-2 yr-1). Areas cultivated with wheat are sensitive to erosion, especially during winter, generating intermediate amounts of runoff and sediment loss (17.6 t km-2 yr-1) especially under rainfalls higher than 280 mm per year. Olives grown under semi natural conditions, as for example with an understory of vegetation of annual plants greatly restrict soil loss to nil values (0.8 t km-2 yr-1). Erosion in shrublands increased with decreasing annual rainfall to values in the range 280-300 mm and then it decreased with decreasing rainfall (average sediment loss 6.7 t km-2 yr-1).},

  abstract = {A coupling of above-ground plant diversity and below-ground microbial diversity has been implied in studies dedicated to assessing the role of macrophyte diversity on the stability, resilience, and functioning of ecosystems. Indeed, above-ground plant communities have long been assumed to drive below-ground microbial diversity, but to date very little is known as to how plant species composition and diversity influence the community composition of micro-organisms in the soil. We examined this relationship in fields subjected to different above-ground biodiversity treatments and in field experiments designed to examine the influence of plant species on soil-borne microbial communities. Culture-independent strategies were applied to examine the role of wild or native plant species composition on bacterial diversity and community structure in bulk soil and in the rhizosphere. In comparing the influence of Cynoglossum officinale (hound's tongue) and Cirsium vulgare (spear thistle) on soil-borne bacterial communities, detectable differences in microbial community structure were confined to the rhizosphere. The colonisation of the rhizosphere of both plants was highly reproducible, and maintained throughout the growing season. In a separate experiment, effects of plant diversity on bacterial community profiles were also only observed for the rhizosphere. Rhizosphere soil from experimental plots with lower macrophyte diversity showed lower diversity, and bacterial diversity was generally lower in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil. These results demonstrate that the level of coupling between above-ground macrophyte communities and below-ground microbial communities is related to the tightness of the interactions involved. Although plant species composition and community structure appear to have little discernible effect on microbial communities inhabiting bulk soil, clear and reproducible changes in microbial community structure and diversity are observed in the rhizosphere.},

  abstract = {This study investigates how carbon sources of soil microbial communities vary with soil depth. Microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were extracted from 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm depth intervals from agricultural soils and analysed for their stable carbon isotopes ({$\delta$}13C values). The soils had been subjected to a vegetation change from C3 ({$\delta$}13C{$\approx$}-29.3\textperthousand ) to C4 plants ({$\delta$}13C{$\approx$}-12.5\textperthousand ) 40 years previously, which allowed us to trace the carbon flow from plant-derived input (litter, roots, and root exudates) into microbial PLFA. While bulk soil organic matter (SOM) reflected {$\approx$}12\% of the C4-derived carbon in top soil (0-20 cm) and 3\% in deeper soil (40-60 cm), the PLFA had a much higher contribution of C4 carbon of about 64\% in 0-20 cm and 34\% in 40-60 cm. This implies a much faster turnover time of carbon in the microbial biomass compared to bulk SOM. The isotopic signature of bulk SOM and PLFA from C4 cultivated soil decreases with increasing soil depth (-23.7\textperthousand{} to -25.0\textperthousand{} for bulk SOM and -18.3\textperthousand{} to -23.3\textperthousand{} for PLFA), which demonstrates decreasing influence of the isotopic signature of the new C4 vegetation with soil depth. In terms of soil microbial carbon sources this clearly shows a high percentage of C4 labelled and thus young plant carbon as microbial carbon source in topsoils. With increasing soil depth this percentage decreases and SOM is increasingly used as microbial carbon source. Among all PLFA that were associated to different microbial groups it could be observed that (a) depended on availability, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria prefer plant-derived carbon as carbon source, however, (b) Gram-positive bacteria use more SOM-derived carbon sources while Gram-negative bacteria use more plant biomass. This tendency was observed in all three-depth intervals. However, our results also show that microorganisms maintain their preferred carbon sources independent on soil depth with an isotopic shift of 3-4\textperthousand{} from 0-20 to 40-60 cm soil depth. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Well-recognized approaches for soil C accretion include reducing soil disturbance, increasing plant biomass inputs, and enhancing plant diversity. Yet experimental evidence often fails to support anticipated C gains, suggesting that our integrated understanding of soil C accretion remains insufficient. Here we use a unique combination of X-ray micro-tomography and micro-scale enzyme mapping to demonstrate for the first time that plant-stimulated soil pore formation appears to be a major, hitherto unrecognized, determinant of whether new C inputs are stored or lost to the atmosphere. Unlike monocultures, diverse plant communities favor the development of 30\textendash 150\,\textmu m pores. Such pores are the micro-environments associated with higher enzyme activities, and greater abundance of such pores translates into a greater spatial footprint that microorganisms make on the soil and consequently soil C storage capacity.},

Mineralization of native soil organic matter is not regulated by the size, activity or composition of the soil microbial biomass - a new perspective. Soil Biology \& Biochemistry 40, 61-73) recently proposed the "Regulatory Gate" hypothesis, which states that decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is regulated solely by abiotic factors. Without studying the mechanisms of such regulation, Kemmitt with coauthors challenged the classical Winogradsky theory of soil microbiology and questioned the concept of autochtonous and zymogenous microbial populations. In this letter, we revive the significance of microbial activity for SOM decomposition especially for the short-term (hours to weeks) processes and show that the "Regulatory Gate" is (micro)biologically driven. We explain the results of the three experiments in Kemmitt et~al. (2008) from a microbiological point of view and suggest that SOM decomposition is mainly regulated by exoenzymes. We criticize the abiotic Regulatory Gate hypothesis based on bottleneck processes and pools limiting the SOM decomposition rate, comparison of constant and changing environmental conditions, as well as the connection between community structure and functions. We explain the results of Kemmitt et~al. (2008) according to the properties of soil microbial community: functional redundancy and inconsistency between the excessive (but largely inactive) pool of total microbial biomass and the real mineralization activity. Finally, we suggest that to gain new perspectives on SOM decomposition and many other biochemical processes, future studies should focus on hot spots of (micro)biological activity (i.e., the rhizosphere, drillosphere, detritosphere, biopores, etc.) rather than on the bulk soil. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In this re-evaluation of our 10-year old paper on priming effects, I have considered the latest studies and tried to identify the most important needs for future research. Recent publications have shown that the increase or decrease in soil organic matter mineralization (measured as changes of CO2efflux and N mineralization) actually results from interactions between living (microbial biomass) and dead organic matter. The priming effect (PE) is not an artifact of incubation studies, as sometimes supposed, but is a natural process sequence in the rhizosphere and detritusphere that is induced by pulses or continuous inputs of fresh organics. The intensity of turnover processes in such hotspots is at least one order of magnitude higher than in the bulk soil. Various prerequisites for high-quality, informative PE studies are outlined: calculating the budget of labeled and total C; investigating the dynamics of released CO2and its sources; linking C and N dynamics with microbial biomass changes and enzyme activities; evaluating apparent and real PEs; and assessing PE sources as related to soil organic matter stabilization mechanisms. Different approaches for identifying priming, based on the assessment of more than two C sources in CO2and microbial biomass, are proposed and methodological and statistical uncertainties in PE estimation and approaches to eliminating them are discussed. Future studies should evaluate directions and magnitude of PEs according to expected climate and land-use changes and the increased rhizodeposition under elevated CO2as well as clarifying the ecological significance of PEs in natural and agricultural ecosystems. The conclusion is that PEs - the interactions between living and dead organic matter - should be incorporated in models of C and N dynamics, and that microbial biomass should regarded not only as a C pool but also as an active driver of C and N turnover. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, many studies have found that soil C does not necessarily increase with increased plant litter input. Precipitation has increased in arid central Asia, and is predicted to increase more, so we tested the effects of adding fresh organic matter (FOM) and water on soil C sequestration in an arid region in northwest China. The results suggested that added FOM quickly decomposed and had minor effects on the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool to a depth of 30 cm. Both FOM and water addition had significant effects on the soil microbial biomass. The soil microbial biomass increased with added FOM, reached a maximum, and then declined as the FOM decomposed. The FOM had a more significant stimulating effect on microbial biomass with water addition. Under the soil moisture ranges used in this experiment (21.0\%\textendash 29.7\%), FOM input was more important than water addition in the soil C mineralization process. We concluded that short-term FOM input into the belowground soil and water addition do not affect the SOC pool in shrubland in an arid region.},

The principal driver of such a drastic surge in energy demand is the increase in world population which was merely 1 billion in 1800, 1.6 billion in 1900, 6.0 billion in 2000, and is projected to be 7.5 billion in 2030 and 9.2 billion in 2050 before stabilizing at {$\approx$}10 billion by 2100. Heavy reliance on fossil-fuel consumption has increased atmospheric CO2 abundance from 280 ppm in 1750 to 383 ppm in 2008 and is increasing at {$\approx$}2 ppm (4.2 Pg) per year along with the attendant threat of climate disruption. Similar to the close link between energy use and atmospheric chemistry, there also exists a close link between food insecurity and climate change through degradation of soils and desertification of the ecosystems. Global annual per capita cereal consumption increased from 267 kg in 1950, peaked at 339 kg in 1985, and decreased to 303 kg by 2000. In the quest for identifying alternate sources of energy, world production of bioethanol (mostly from corn grains in USA and sugarcane in Brazil) was 65 billion L, and that of biodiesel was 13 million Mg (t) (55\% in EU countries) in 2008. Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, using crop residues or establishing energy plantations, has severe constraints of the additional requirements for land area, water, and plant nutrients. Removal of crop residues for energy and other uses has severe adverse impacts on soil quality and agronomic productivity. Yet, globally average crop yields must be increased by 60\% to 120\% between 2000 and 2050 for meeting the needs of increase in population and change in dietary habits. Meeting demands of the growing world population and rising aspirations necessitate serious and objective considerations of change in food habits (to a more vegan diet), improvement in energy-use efficiency, increase in crop yield per unit area and input, restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems, widespread adoption of recommended soil and crop practices, and identification of non-C fuel sources. \textcopyright{} 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Co-benefits of soil C sequestration include: advancing food and nutritional security, increasing renewability and quality of water, improving biodiversity, and strengthening elemental recycling. Threshold level of soil organic C (SOC) in the root zone is 1.5-2.0\%. SOC is influenced by land use, soil management and farming systems. To 1-m depth, more than 50\% total C pool is contained between 0.3 and 1m depth. Soils of agroecosystems are strongly depleted of their SOC stock and are degraded. Restoring soil quality necessitates increasing SOC concentration by adopting best management practices (i.e., conservation agriculture) which create a positive C budget. French Government is proposing to COP-21 of UNFCCC in December 2015 that SOC concentration be increased globally at 4 per 1000 per year to mitigate climate change and advance food security.},

Soil degradation, characterized by decline in quality and decrease in ecosystem goods and services, is a major constraint to achieving the required increase in agricultural production. Soil is a non-renewable resource on human time scales with its vulnerability to degradation depending on complex interactions between processes, factors and causes occurring at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Among the major soil degradation processes are accelerated erosion, depletion of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool and loss in biodiversity, loss of soil fertility and elemental imbalance, acidification and salinization. Soil degradation trends can be reversed by conversion to a restorative land use and adoption of recommended management practices. The strategy is to minimize soil erosion, create positive SOC and N budgets, enhance activity and species diversity of soil biota (micro, meso, and macro), and improve structural stability and pore geometry. Improving soil quality (i.e., increasing SOC pool, improving soil structure, enhancing soil fertility) can reduce risks of soil degradation (physical, chemical, biological and ecological) while improving the environment. Increasing the SOC pool to above the critical level (10 to 15 g/kg) is essential to set-in-motion the restorative trends. Site-specific techniques of restoring soil quality include conservation agriculture, integrated nutrient management, continuous vegetative cover such as residue mulch and cover cropping, and controlled grazing at appropriate stocking rates. The strategy is to produce ``more from less'' by reducing losses and increasing soil, water, and nutrient use efficiency.},

Periodically, the soil was sampled from two layers, 0\textendash 2 and 6\textendash 14mm below the filter's surface, which were indicated as rhizosphere and bulk soils, respectively. The isotope dilution technique was used to determine the effect of these low molecular weight organic compounds (LMWOCs) on gross N mineralization and immobilization rates. From 0 to 3d both glucose and oxalic acid amended soils showed a rapid evolution of CO2, more pronunced in the latter treatment together with a decrease in the amount of mineral N of the rhizosphere soil, probably due to N immobilization. Nevertheless, these changes were accompanied by a very small increase in the net ATP content probably because the low C application rate stimulated microbial activity but microbial growth only slightly. A positive `priming effect' probably developed in the oxalic acid amended soil but not in the glucose amended soil. Gross N mineralization and immobilization rates were only observed in the rhizosphere soil, probably due to the greater C and N concentrations and microbial activity, and were a little higher in both amended soils than in the control soil, only between 1 and 7d. Both glucose and oxalic acid influenced the bacterial communities of the rhizosphere soil, as new bands in the DGGE profiles appeared at 3 and 7d. Glucose induced lower changes in the bacterial community than oxalic acid, presumably because the former stimulated a larger proportion of soil microorganisms whereas the latter was decomposed by specialized microorganisms. Peaks of net daily soil respiration and net ATP content and the appearence of new dominant bacterial populations were shifted in time, probably because there was less ATP synthesis and DGGE patterns changed after complete substrate mineralization.},

  abstract = {Plant diversity drives changes in the soil microbial community which may result in alterations in ecosystem functions. However, the governing factors between the composition of soil microbial communities and plant diversity are not well understood. We investigated the impact of plant diversity (plant species richness and functional group richness) and plant functional group identity on soil microbial biomass and soil microbial community structure in experimental grassland ecosystems. Total microbial biomass and community structure were determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. The diversity gradient covered 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 plant species and 1, 2, 3 and 4 plant functional groups (grasses, legumes, small herbs and tall herbs). In May 2007, soil samples were taken from experimental plots and from nearby fields and meadows. Beside soil texture, plant species richness was the main driver of soil microbial biomass. Structural equation modeling revealed that the positive plant diversity effect was mainly mediated by higher leaf area index resulting in higher soil moisture in the top soil layer. The fungal-to-bacterial biomass ratio was positively affected by plant functional group richness and negatively by the presence of legumes. Bacteria were more closely related to abiotic differences caused by plant diversity, while fungi were more affected by plant-derived organic matter inputs. We found diverse plant communities promoted faster transition of soil microbial communities typical for arable land towards grassland communities. Although some mechanisms underlying the plant diversity effect on soil microorganisms could be identified, future studies have to determine plant traits shaping soil microbial community structure. We suspect differences in root traits among different plant communities, such as root turnover rates and chemical composition of root exudates, to structure soil microbial communities. ? 2014 Lange et al.},

Field CO2 fluxes from soil, throughout a year, were also determined. Moreover, C input and output were assessed, as well as microbial and metabolic quotients. Tillage management more than cropping system affected the soil organic C stored in the first 15 cm of soil. After 19 years, no-tillage caused a 3.6 Mg ha-1 increase of C content in wheat/faba rotation while of 5.6 Mg ha-1 in wheat monoculture. The higher soil total organic C content in wheat monoculture was ascribed to a lower quality of residues supplied (higher both C/N ratio and acid detergent fibre (ADF) content). Moreover, wheat/bean rotation increased soil microbial biomass C, basal respiration and microbial quotient, thus suggesting that crop rotation more than tillage management was the driving factor in improving soil biochemical indicators. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent disorders of childhood and adolescence. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety poses a challenge for clinicians as it requires active client participation, and many children either decline or do not adequately comply with treatment. In addition, even after treatment with CBT, up to 50\% of children remain symptomatic, and many still meet diagnostic criteria. Parent-directed clinical work has been advocated as a potential enhancer of treatment outcomes, and exclusively parent-based interventions might replace child treatment when the child is reluctant. However, parent involvement has yet to be shown to significantly improve outcomes, relative to child-only therapy. Studies so far have focused mainly on including parents in children's therapy, training parents as lay therapists, or teaching parenting skills. Parent training focused on parental behaviors specific to childhood anxiety, such as family accommodation, may be more effective. In this treatment development report we present the theoretical foundation, structure, and strategies of a novel parent-based intervention for childhood anxiety disorders. We will also present the results of an open trial of the treatment, with an emphasis on feasibility, acceptability, and initial outcomes. Participants in the trial were parents of 10 children, aged 9 to 13. Children had declined individual child treatment. Multiple excerpts from the treatment manual are included with the hope of ``bringing the treatment to life'' and conveying a rich sense of the therapeutic process. Parents participated in 10 weekly sessions. Significant improvement was reported in child anxiety and family accommodation as well as in the child's motivation for individual treatment. No parents dropped out and satisfaction was high. The SPACE Program (Supportive Parenting for Anxious Childhood Emotions) is a novel, manualized parent-based intervention that is feasible and acceptable and may be effective in improving childhood anxiety.},

  abstract = {Transformations of plant-derived carbon into soil organic carbon (SOC) influences both local and global carbon cycles. Soil bacteria play a major role in SOC transformations, which are important for maintaining soil fertility and for stabilizing carbon in soil. SOC is consumed by bacteria in soil and transformed into biomass or respired to carbon dioxide. This bacterial-driven partitioning of SOC is defined as Bacterial Growth Efficiency (BGE) and it is an integral component of models that simulate carbon dynamics. We tested the variability of BGE in microbial communities from soil by measuring bacterial production (BP) and respiration (BR), the two components of BGE, in slurries of soils collected from deciduous forests and croplands at the Kellogg Biological Station Long Term Ecological Research site. BP was measured as 3H-leucine incorporation into protein and BR as oxygen consumption. The differences in BP and BR in soil under different land management practices revealed that BGE was not static but varied from 0.23 to 0.63, supporting more recent SOC models. Bacterial communities from soils of soybean monoculture cropland tended to have a higher BGE than those from deciduous forests. BGE of cropland soil microbes exhibited a large seasonal variation not observed in forest soils. Nutrient amendments on rotation cropland soil microcosms showed that BGE is sensitive to substrate availability and nutrient stoichiometry. Using a range of growth efficiency expected of terrestrial ecosystem, simulations of carbon dynamics in a forest using the DAYCENT model revealed the sensitivity of equilibrium soil carbon values to changes in growth efficiency. Decreasing the default growth efficiency of 0.45 to a growth efficiency of 0.35 reduced the active carbon fraction by 22\%. This sensitivity emphasizes the importance of site-specific BGE measurements for improving the predictive capacity of SOC models, especially when investigating the effects of changes in land management practices on labile SOC transformation. The weak correlation of BP and BR in most soil tested also showed that BGE is a more valuable measurement than the common interpretation of bacterial activity based on BR.},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environ- \textbackslash nmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

Erodibility is seemingly determined by the capacity of surface aggregates to resist the effects of rainfall. In this paper, we evaluated the relevance of an aggregate stability measurement, which comprises three treatments, in order to characterize aggregate breakdown dynamics. Two cultivated soils were studied: a clay loam slightly sensitive to erosion and a more susceptible silt loam. We compared the size distributions of microaggregates produced by the three aggregate stability treatments with the results from a rainfall simulation. The behaviour of four initial aggregate size classes ({$<$} 3 mm, 3-5 mm, 5-10 mm and 10-20 mm) was also compared to study the influence of the initial aggregate size on the nature of resulting aggregates. The mean weight diameter was from 200 to 1400 mum for the silt loam and from 600 to 7000 mum for the clay loam. The two experiments - aggregate stability measurements and aggregate breakdown dynamics under rainfall - yielded similar results. Qualitative analysis showed that for both soils the sizes of fragments produced by breakdown with the aggregate stability tests and under rainfall were similar and seemed to be qualitatively independent of the size of initial aggregates. We first schematized the structural organization of aggregates in cultivated horizons with a simple hierarchical model at two levels: (i) {$<$} 250 mum microaggregates and (ii) {$>$} 250 mum macroaggregates made by the binding together of microaggregates. We then developed a model of aggregate breakdown dynamics under rainfall which gives, for various rainfall durations, the size distributions of resulting fragments on the basis of aggregate stability measurements. We obtained a correlation coefficient, r, of 0.87 for the silt loam and of 0.91 for the clay loam, showing that the experimental and predicted mass percentages were linearly related for each size fraction.},

Respiration, soil mineral N content, and WSA (expressed as mean-weight diameter, MWD) were measured on several dates during a 56-d incubation. The effect of decomposing crop residues on WSA followed two phases. (i) Between 0 and 7 d, the increase in WSA was related to intrinsic residue quality with higher decomposability of the wheat straw resulting in higher WSA. (ii) Thereafter, and until the end of the experiment, mineral N addition rates had a predominant but negative influence on WSA. In this second phase, the average MWD of residue-treated soils was 0.92, 0.55, and 0.44 mm for the 0, 60 and 120 mg N kg \`A1 dry soil addition rates, respectively. Mineral N addition which did result in higher crop residue decomposition did not lead to higher WSA. WSA during crop residue decomposition is therefore not simply positively related to the induced microbial activity, and changes in microbial community composition with differential effects on WSA must be involved. The impact of high-C/N crop residues inputs on WSA, initially assumed to be low, could actually be strong and long-lasting in situations with low soil mineral N content.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of soil water-stable aggregation (WSA) following organic matter (OM) addition are controlled by microbial activity, which in turn is influenced by carbon substrate quality and mineral N availability. However, the role of microbial communities in determining WSA at different stages of OM decomposition remains largely unknown. This study aimed at evaluating the role of microbial communities in WSA during OM decomposition as affected by mineral N. In a 35-day incubation experiment, we studied the decomposition of two high-C/N crop residues (miscanthus, C/N = 311.3; and wheat, C/N = 125.6) applied at 4 g C kg -1 dry soil with or without mineral N addition (120 mg N kg -1 dry soil). Microbial characteristics were measured at day 0, 7, and 35 of the experiment, and related to previous results of WSA. Early increase in WSA (at 7 days) was related to an overall increase of the microbial biomass (MBC) with wheat residues showing higher values in MBC and WSA than miscanthus. In the intermediate stage of decomposition (from day 7 to 35), the dynamics of WSA were more associated with the dynamics of microbial polysaccharides and greatly influenced by mineral N addition. Mineral N addition resulted in a decrease or leveling off of WSA whereas it increased in its absence. We suggest that opportunistic bacterial populations stimulated by N addition may have consumed binding agents which decreased WSA or prevented its increase. To the contrary, microbial polysaccharide production was high when no mineral N was added which led to the higher WSA in the late stage of decomposition in this treatment. The late stage of decomposition was associated with a particular fungal community also influenced by the mineral N treatment. We suggest that WSA dynamics in the late stage of decomposition can be considered as a ?? narrow process 3 where the structure of the microbial community plays a greater role than during the initial stages. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We begin by defining soil quality/soil health (which we consider to be interchangeable terms), characterizing healthy soil resources, and relating the significance of soil health to agroecosystems and their functions. We examine how soil biology influences soil health and how biological properties and processes contribute to sustainability of agriculture and ecosystem services. We continue by examining what can be done to manipulate soil biology to: (i) increase nutrient availability for production of high yielding, high quality crops; (ii) protect crops from pests, pathogens, weeds; and (iii) manage other factors limiting production, provision of ecosystem services, and resilience to stresses like droughts. Next we look to the future by asking what needs to be known about soil biology that is not currently recognized or fully understood and how these needs could be addressed using emerging research tools. We conclude, based on our perceptions of how new knowledge regarding soil biology will help make agriculture more sustainable and productive, by recommending research emphases that should receive first priority through enhanced public and private research in order to reverse the trajectory toward global soil degradation.},

X-ray spectromicroscopy has enabled the identification of spatial variability of organic matter forms, but was limited to extracted soil particles4 and individual micropores within aggregates5, 6. Here, we use synchrotron-based near-edge X-ray spectromicroscopy7 of thin sections of entire and intact free microaggregates6 to demonstrate that on spatial scales below 50 nm resolution, highly variable yet identifiable organic matter forms, such as plant or microbial biopolymers, can be found in soils at distinct locations of the mineral assemblage. Organic carbon forms detected at this spatial scale had no similarity to organic carbon forms of total soil. In contrast, we find that organic carbon forms of total soil were remarkably similar between soils from several temperate and tropical forests with very distinct vegetation composition and soil mineralogy. Spatial information on soil organic matter forms at the scale provided here could help to identify processes of organic matter cycling in soil, such as carbon stability or sequestration and responses to a changing climate.},

We used 13C-labelled glucose as a model C compound representing root exudates to follow the incorporation of root-derived C into the soil animal food web of a temperate grassland over a period of 52 weeks. We investigated variations in glucose C incorporation with fertilizer addition and sward composition, i.e. variations in plant functional groups. The approach allowed the differentiation of trophic chains based on primary decomposers feeding on litter and phytophagous species feeding on roots (i.e. not incorporating glucose C) from those based on secondary decomposers feeding on microorganisms (thereby assimilating glucose C). Each of the studied soil animal species incorporated glucose C, indicating that the majority of grassland soil animal species rely on microorganisms as food resources with microorganisms being fuelled by root exudates. However, incorporation of glucose C into soil animal species varied markedly with species identity, suggesting that detritivorous microarthropods complement each other in channelling microbial C through soil food webs. Fertilizer addition markedly reduced the concentration of glucose C in most soil animal species as well as the absolute transfer of glucose C into oribatid mites as major secondary decomposers. The results suggest that fertilizer addition shifts the basis of the decomposer food web towards the use of unlabelled resources, presumably roots, i.e. towards a herbivore system, thereby lessening the link between microorganisms and microbial grazers and hampering the propagation of microbial C to higher trophic levels.},

In the long-term dataset, SMB variables generally showed stronger correlations with the relative PSP (rPSP) compared to soil chemical properties. Both correlation and variation partitioning analyses suggested that SMB N, P and C:N ratio were good predictors of rPSP. In the short-term dataset, we found a significant, negative correlation of annual rice yield with SMB C:N (r = -0.99), confirming SMB C:N as a robust indicator for PSP. In treatments of the short-term experiment, soil amendment with biochar lowered SMB C:N and improved PSP, while incorporation of rice straw increased SMB C:N and reduced PSP. We conclude that SMB C:N ratio does not only indicate PSP but also helps to identify management practices that improve PSP.},

Soil samples were analyzed to determine labile C pools (including dissolved organic C, DOC; light free organic C, LFOC; and microbial biomass C, MBC), microbial community composition (using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles) and SOC mineralization rate (from a 124-day incubation experiment). This study demonstrated that the application of chemical fertilizers (NP) alone did not alter labile C fractions, soil microbial communities and SOC mineralization rate from those observed in the CK treatment. Whereas the use of straw in conjunction with chemical fertilizers (NPS) became an additional labile substrate supply that decreased C limitation, stimulated growth of all PLFA-related microbial communities, and resulted in 53\% higher cumulative mineralization of C compared to that of CK. The SOC and its labile fractions explained 78.7\% of the variance of microbial community structure. Further addition of manure on the top of straw in the NPSM treatment did not significantly increase microbial community abundances, but it did alter microbial community structure by increasing G+/G- ratio compared to that of NPS. The cumulative mineralization of C was 85\% higher under NPSM fertilization compared to that of CK. Particularly, the NPSM treatment increased the mineralization rate of the resistant pool. This has to be carefully taken into account when setting realistic and effective goals for long-term soil C stabilization.},

Returning crop residues to soil is known to strongly influence soil C stocks, but the specific contribution of crop residues to soil aggregates influenced by long-term fertilization remains largely unknown. This study investigated the effects of long-term fertilization on the distribution of 13 C-labeled maize straw residue in different aggregate size fractions and their retention in soils over a 1-year incubation. Materials and methods The dynamic variation and the distribution of maize straw-derived 13 C in soil aggregates were monitored using a 13 C stable isotope mass-balance approach. The following three fertilization treatments were selected: (1) without fertilization (CK), (2) mineral fertilizer (NPK), and (3) cow manure with mineral fertilizer (NPKM). Soil samples were collected from the surface layer (0-20 cm) of a long-term field experiment of Mollisols (Luvic Phaeozem) in 2015 at Gongzhuling, Jilin Province, China, which was established in 1980. Soils were incubated for 360 days at 25 \textdegree C, with or without 13 C-labeled maize straw and destructively collected on the days of 45, 90, 135, 180, and 360. Soil aggregates were separated into two fractions (macroaggregates, {$>$} 250 {$\mu$}m; microaggregate, {$<$} 250 {$\mu$}m) by wet sieving. Results and discussion The NPK treatment retained the most of maize straw 13 C in macroaggregates (28.49\%), but more maize straw 13 C was incorporated in microaggregates for NPKM soil (4.02\%) than NPK and CK on day 45. The highest amount of maize straw 13 C was incorporated in macroaggregate on the days of 90, 135, and 180, and in microaggregate on the days of 135, 45, and 135 for CK, NPK, and NPKM, respectively. Organic manure-amended soil tended to sequester more maize straw 13 C in the microaggregate fractions as compared with the NPK and CK treatments throughout the incubation. The maize straw 13 C remaining in both of macro-and microaggregates followed the order of NPKM {$>$} NPK {$>$} CK for all soil aggregates after the 360-day incubation. Conclusions Our results illustrated that long-term application of manure with mineral fertilizer helps to stabilize or increase the retention of exogenous C in the soil aggregates.},

  abstract = {The number of studies focused on the transformation and sequestration of soil organic carbon (C) has dramatically increased in recent years due to growing interest in understanding the global C cycle. While it is readily accepted that terrestrial C dynamics are heavily influenced by the catabolic and anabolic activities of microorganisms, the incorporation of microbial biomass components into stable soil C pools (via microbial living cells and necromass) has received less attention. Nevertheless, microbial-derived C inputs to soils are now increasingly recognized as playing a far greater role in stabilization of soil organic matter than previously believed. Our understanding, however, is limited by the difficulties associated with studying microbial turnover in soils. Here, we describe the use of an Absorbing Markov Chain (AMC) to model the dynamics of soil C transformations among three microbial states: living microbial biomass, microbial necromass, and C removed from living and dead microbial sources. We find that AMC provides a powerful quantitative approach that allows prediction of how C will be distributed among these three states, and how long it will take for the entire amount of initial C to pass through the biomass and necromass pools and be moved into atmosphere. Further, assuming constant C inputs to the model, we can predict how C is eventually distributed, along with how much C sequestrated in soil is microbial-derived. Our work represents a first step in attempting to quantify the flow of C through microbial pathways, and has the potential to increase our understanding of the microbial role in soil C dynamics.},

  abstract = {Studies of the decomposition, transformation and stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) have dramatically increased in recent years owing to growing interest in studying the global carbon (C) cycle as it pertains to climate change. While it is read- ily accepted that the magnitude of the organic C reservoir in soils depends upon microbial involvement, as soil C dynamics are ultimately the consequence of microbial growth and activity, it remains largely unknown how these microorganism-mediated processes lead to soil C stabilization. Here, we define two pathways\textemdash ex vivo modification and in vivo turnover\textemdash which jointly explain soil C dynamics driven by microbial catabolism and/or anabolism. Accordingly, we use the conceptual framework of the soil `microbial carbon pump' (MCP) to demonstrate how microorganisms are an active player in soil C storage. The MCP couples microbial production of a set of organic compounds to their further stabilization, which we define as the entombing effect. This integration captures the cumulative long-term legacy of microbial assimilation on SOM formation, with mechanisms (whether via physical protection or a lack of activation energy due to chemical composition) that ultimately enable the entombment of microbial-derived C in soils. We propose a need for increased efforts and seek to inspire new studies that utilize the soil MCP as a conceptual guideline for improving mechanistic understandings of the contributions of soil C dynamics to the responses of the terrestrial C cycle under global change.},

This study focused on Mollisol and its particle-size fractions of 200-2,000 mu m (coarse sand sized), 63 to 200 mu m (fine sand sized), 2 to 63 mu m (silt sized), and 0.1 to 2 to mu m (clay-sized). Long-term chemical fertilization lowered the pH of all particle fractions, whereas organic fertilizer application mitigated soil acidification. Nutrient concentrations depended on both fertilizer treatment and particle fractions and enzymes were unevenly active throughout the soil. Generally, the highest enzyme activities were observed in the silt and clay fractions of control soil and the soil treated with chemical fertilizer (N, P, and K (NPK)) and in the sand-sized fraction of soil treated with manure and chemical fertilizer (MNPK). Except for acid phosphomonoesterase, the other tested enzyme activities in coarse-sized fractions of MNPK soil were significantly higher than those of the control and NPK soils. Fertilization and soil fraction interactively (p {$<$} 0.05) affected the enzyme activity. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the bacterial community structure significantly differed in different particle sizes with a higher bacterial diversity in small-sized than in coarse-sized fractions. Dominant bands were excised and sequenced. We have found the following bacterial groups: Actinobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria. In addition, enrichment of organic matter in coarser fractions was related to greater bacterial diversity than any other treatment. Principal component analysis showed a smaller variability among fractions of the organic amended treatment. Redundancy analysis showed that the tested properties significantly affected the composition of bacterial community with the exception of C/N and available P. No significant correlation between enzyme activity and bacterial community composition was detected, whereas positive correlations between other soil properties and enzyme activities were observed to various extents. Probably, enzyme activities might be affected by specific functional bacterial communities rather than by the overall bacterial community. We concluded that the long-term application of organic manures contributed to the increase of soil organic matter content of particles higher than 200 mm, with higher bacterial diversity and increases in most of the enzyme activities.},

Our objective was to compare physically and chemically renovated grasslands and to quantify temporal variations of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, water-stable aggregates and SOC stored in different aggregate fractions. Soil samples were taken on a sandy soil before (T{$_0$}), 6~days (T{$_{6}\_$}d\textsubscript{a}y\textsubscript{s}), 2 (T{$_{2}\__{mo}$}), 7 (T{$_{7}\__{mo}$}) and 12~months (T{$_{12}\__{mo}$}) after grassland renovation and in permanent grassland. Neither grassland renovation practice led to SOC losses in 0\textendash 10~cm after 12~months. The physical renovation led to an increase in microaggregates (53\textendash 250~{$\mu$}m) in the surface soil between T{$_0$} and T{$_{6}\_$}d\textsubscript{a}y\textsubscript{s} and to highest microaggregate concentrations in T{$_{2}\__{mo}$} and T{$_{7}\__{mo}$}. Therefore, ploughing seems to have direct negative effects on macroaggregates (10~mm\textendash 250~{$\mu$}m) followed by indirect longer-lasting negative effects which were nullified after 1~year. Chemical renovation resulted in no different aggregate distribution than permanent grassland. Strong temporal variations in aggregate distribution were found especially for large macroaggregates with lowest concentrations in T{$_{6}\_$}d\textsubscript{a}y\textsubscript{s} and 6.7- to 10.2-fold higher concentrations in T{$_{2}\__{mo}$}.

  abstract = {Soil microbial respiration is a critical component of the global carbon cycle, but it is uncertain how properties of microbes affect this process. Previous studies have noted a thermodynamic trade-off between the rate and efficiency of growth in heterotrophic organisms. Growth rate and yield determine the biomass-specific respiration rate of growing microbial populations, but these traits have not previously been used to scale from microbial communities to ecosystems. Here we report seasonal variation in microbial growth kinetics and temperature responses (Q(10)) in a coniferous forest soil, relate these properties to cultured and uncultured soil microbes, and model the effects of shifting growth kinetics on soil heterotrophic respiration (R-h). Soil microbial communities from under-snow had higher growth rates and lower growth yields than the summer and fall communities from exposed soils, causing higher biomass-specific respiration rates. Growth rate and yield were strongly negatively correlated. Based on experiments using specific growth inhibitors, bacteria had higher growth rates and lower yields than fungi, overall, suggesting a more important role for bacteria in determining R-h. The dominant bacteria from laboratory-incubated soil differed seasonally: faster-growing, cold-adapted Janthinobacterium species dominated in winter and slower-growing, mesophilic Burkholderia and Variovorax species dominated in summer. Modeled R-h was sensitive to microbial kinetics and Q(10): a sixfold lower annual R-h resulted from using kinetic parameters from summer versus winter communities. Under the most realistic scenario using seasonally changing communities, the model estimated R-h at 22.67 mol m(-2) year(-1), or 47.0\% of annual total ecosystem respiration (R-e) for this forest.},

In this paper, we examined the relationship of plant species diversity with soil microbial biomass C, microbial catabolic activity, catabolic diversity and catabolic richness along a longitudinal gradient in temperate grasslands of Hulunbeir, Inner Mongolia, China. Preliminary detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) indicated that plant composition showed a significant separation along the axis 1, and axis 1 explained the main portion of variability in the data set. Moreover, DCA-axis 1 was significantly correlated with soil microbial biomass C (r = 0.735, P = 0.001), microbial catabolic activity (average well color development; r = 0.775, P {$<$} 0.001) and microbial functional diversity (catabolic diversity: r = 0.791, P {$<$} 0.001 and catabolic richness: r = 0.812, P {$<$} 0.001), which suggested thatsome relationship existed between plant composition and the soil microbial community along the spatial gradient at a large scale. Soil microbial biomass C, microbial catabolic activity, catabolic diversity and catabolic richness showed a significant, linear increase with greater plant species richness. However, many responses that we observed could be explained by greater aboveground plant biomass associated with higher levels of plant diversity, which suggested that plant diversity impacted the soil microbial community mainly through increases in plant production.},

The calculated GWFs and WPLs of the different river basins show a large variation among different periods. WPL values generally increased between 1970 and 2000. For the year 2000 about two-thirds of the basins have WPL values exceeding 1 for N or P, indicating that the pollution assimilation capacity has been fully consumed. Even though the other rivers have a WPL{$<$}1, this does not guarantee that at sub-basin level or within particular periods of the year no eutrophication exists. High WPLs are generally found in rivers in tropical\textendash subtropical areas. For dissolved organic N and P, the problems are located mostly in the southern hemisphere. The results indicate that many rivers may become more polluted with dissolved N and P in the future.},

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of long-term fertilization on SOC and SOC fractions for the whole soil profile (0\textendash 100 cm) in northwest China. The study was initiated in 1979 in Gansu, China and included six treatments: unfertilized control (CK), nitrogen fertilizer (N), nitrogen and phosphorus (P) fertilizers (NP), straw plus N and P fertilizers (NP+S), farmyard manure (FYM), and farmyard manure plus N and P fertilizers (NP+FYM). Results showed that SOC concentration in the 0\textendash 20 cm soil layer increased with time except in the CK and N treatments. Long-term fertilization significantly influenced SOC concentrations and storage to 60 cm depth. Below 60 cm, SOC concentrations and storages were statistically not significant between all treatments. The concentration of SOC at different depths in 0\textendash 60 cm soil profile was higher under NP+FYM follow by under NP+S, compared to under CK. The SOC storage in 0\textendash 60 cm in NP+FYM, NP+S, FYM and NP treatments were increased by 41.3\%, 32.9\%, 28.1\% and 17.9\%, respectively, as compared to the CK treatment. Organic manure plus inorganic fertilizer application also increased labile soil organic carbon pools in 0\textendash 60 cm depth. The average concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in organic manure plus inorganic fertilizer treatments (NP+S and NP+FYM) in 0\textendash 60 cm depth were increased by 64.9\textendash 91.9\%, 42.5\textendash 56.9\%, and 74.7\textendash 99.4\%, respectively, over the CK treatment. The POC, MBC and DOC concentrations increased linearly with increasing SOC content. These results indicate that long-term additions of organic manure have the most beneficial effects in building carbon pools among the investigated types of fertilization.},

Numerous studies have compared biodiversity in soil receiving organic fertilizer to soil under other fertilizer regimes (inorganic fertilizers, unfertilized), yet the data were not analyzed systematically across studies. We evaluated fertilizer effects on soil nematode communities with a meta-analysis of more than 229 data points from 54 studies around the world that were published between 1996 and 2015. Data were from cropland and considered five fertilizer regimes. These regimes include unfertilized soils and those receiving inorganic fertilizers (2 regimes), as well as organic fertilizers (2 regimes). Species richness and total nematode abundance increased with increasing carbon (C) inputs from fertilizers, whereas greater nitrogen (N) application rates from fertilizers significantly reduced the species richness, Shannon's diversity (H{${'}$}), maturity index (MI) and omnivore-predator nematode abundance. This could indicate that high fertilizer N inputs simplifies the nematode community structure and functions. Species richness, omnivore-predator nematode abundance and structural index (SI) increased with the organically-fertilized regime and declined in inorganically-fertilized regimes, suggesting that organic fertilizers can buffer stresses and sustain soil food web functions. Furthermore, organic fertilizers differed in their impact on soil nematodes, as those with C-rich crop residues supported larger free-living nematode populations and greatly promoted H{${'}$}, SI and enrichment index (EI), whereas N-rich animal manure was more effective in controlling plant-feeding nematodes. Our review suggests that the application of C-rich crop residues is the most effective practice to enhance soil biodiversity in intensively managed agroecosystems, highlighting the importance of regular applications of straw and other C-rich residues to preserve the ecological resilience of cropland.},

Principal components analysis was applied to the data and the relationship among microbial metabolic quotient (qCO2), labile C pools, and MBC revealed a decrease in efficiency of organic substrate utilization with an increase in availability and lability of the organic matter.},

  abstract = {In the last century, many calcareous soils in Castilla Le\'on (northwestern Spain) have been transformed from natural Quercus ilex forest to cropped land. During the past 40 years, cropping was abandoned and some of these soils has been reforested with Pinus halepensis. We studied how thEse land use changes affected the soil organic matter amount (C stocks) and characteristics. Density fractionation combined with ultrasonic dispersion enables separation and study of soil OM fractions, considered on the basis of the mechanisms of physical protection: non-physically protected OM (FF), OM occluded into aggregates (OF), and OM stabilized in organo-mineral complexes (DF). In the present study, whole soils and density fractions were analyzed for organic C amount (OC) and for carbohydrate content. The study aimed to describe the carbohydrate content in whole soils and its SOM density fractions to find out whether the carbohydrates can be used to explain the origin of SOM fractions and if they can depict its response to land management. We found a loss of 67\% of the topsoil OC as a result of converting the natural Quercus ilex forest to cropped land, {$\sim$}100 years ago. After crop abandonment and soil reforestation with Pinus halepensis, the stock of topsoil OC increased. After {$\sim$}40 years of pine plantation, an average recovery of 71\% of the previously lost OC had been recovered (43\% loss of reference topsoil). The changes in OC stocks affected mainly the free fraction (FF) but also the organo-mineral (DF) one. Our results point to the role of physical protection in the C stocks but also that organo-mineral associations could be disrupted under a land use change. Monosaccharide content was significantly different (p {$<$} 0.01) among land uses. Gas chromatography analysis revealed significant differences in monosaccharide composition between land uses and also among density fractions. Whatever the fraction and land use considered, glucose was the dominant sugar monomer, followed by mannose and xylose.},

This study examined, under laboratory conditions, effects of organic amendments comprised of differing proportions of labile and semi-labile C on microbial community structure and macroaggregate formation in three variously textured soils where native structure was destroyed. Three amendment treatments were imposed (in order of increasing C lability): vegetable compost, dairy manure, hairy vetch ( Vicia villosa Roth). Formation of water stable macroaggregates and changes in microbial community structure were evaluated over 82 days. Regardless of soil type, formation of large macroaggregates (LMA, {$>$}2000. ??m diameter) was highest in soils amended with vetch, followed by manure, non-amended control, and compost. Vetch and manure had greater microbially available C and caused an increase in fungal biomarkers in all soils. Regression analysis indicated that LMA formation was most strongly related to the relative abundance of the fungal fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) 18:2??6c ( r= 0.55, p{$<$}. 0.001), fungal ergosterol ( r= 0.58, p{$<$}. 0.001), and microbial biomass ( r= 0.57, p{$<$}. 0.001). Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination of FAME profiles revealed that vetch and manure drove shifts toward fungal-dominated soil microbial communities and greater LMA formation in these soils. This study demonstrated that, due to their greater amounts of microbially available C, vetch or manure inputs can be used to promote fungal proliferation in order to maintain or improve soil structure. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The formation of soil organic matter (SOM) very much depends on microbial activity. Even more, latest studies identified microbial necromass itself being a significant source of SOM and found microbial products to initiate and enhance the formation of long-term stabilized SOM. The objectives of this study were to investigate the microbial contribution to SOM in pools of different stability and its impact on SOM quality. Hence, four arable soils of widely differing properties were density-fractionated into free and occluded particulate organic matter (fPOM, oPOM{$<$}1.6gcm-3 and oPOM{$<$}2.0gcm-3) and mineral associated organic matter (MOM{$>$}2.0gcm-3) by using sodium polytungstate. These fractions were characterized by in-source pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS). Main SOM compound classes of the fractions were determined and further SOM properties were derived (polydispersity, thermostability). The contribution of microbial derived input to arable soil OM was estimated from the hexose to pentose ratio of the carbohydrates and the ratio of C4-C26 to C26-C36 fatty acids. Additionally, selected samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for visualizing structures as indicators for the origin of OM. Results showed that, although the samples differed significantly regarding soil properties, SOM composition was comparable and almost 50\% of identifiable SOM compounds of all soils types and all density fractions were assigned to phenols, lignin monomers and alkylaromatics. Most distinguishing were the high contents of carbohydrates for the MOM and of lipids for the POM fractions. Qualitative features such as polydispersity or thermostability were not in general assignable to specific compounds, density fractions or different mean residence times. Only the microbial derived part of the soil carbohydrates could be shown to be correlated with high SOM thermostability (r2=0.63**, n=39). Microbial derived carbohydrates and fatty acids were both enriched in the MOM, showing that the relative contribution of microbial versus plant-derived input to arable SOM increased with density and therefore especially increased MOM thermostability. Nevertheless, the general microbial contribution to arable SOM is suggested to be high for all density fractions; a mean proportion of about 1:1 was estimated for carbohydrates. Despite biomolecules released from living microorganisms, SEM revealed that microbial mass (biomass and necromass) is a considerable source for stable SOM which is also increasing with density.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms for C stabilization in soils have received much interest recently due to their relevance in the global C cycle. Here we review the mechanisms that are currently, but often contradictorily or inconsistently, considered to contribute to organic matter (OM) protection against decomposition in temperate soils: (i) selective preservation due to recalcitrance of OM, including plant litter, rhizodeposits, microbial products, humic polymers, and charred OM; (ii) spatial inaccessibility of OM against decomposer organisms due to occlusion, intercalation, hydrophobicity and encapsulation; and (iii) stabilization by interaction with mineral surfaces (Fe-, Al-, Mn-oxides, phyllosilicates) and metal ions. Our goal is to assess the relevance of these mechanisms to the formation of soil OM during different stages of decomposition and under different soil conditions. The view that OM stabilization is dominated by the selective preservation of recalcitrant organic components that accumulate in proportion to their chemical properties can no longer be accepted. In contrast, our analysis of mechanisms shows that: (i) the soil biotic community is able to disintegrate any OM of natural origin; (ii) molecular recalcitrance of OM is relative, rather than absolute; (iii) recalcitrance is only important during early decomposition and in active surface soils; while (iv) during late decomposition and in the subsoil, the relevance of spatial inaccessibility and organo-mineral interactions for SOM stabilization increases. We conclude that major difficulties in the understanding and prediction of SOM dynamics originate from the simultaneous operation of several mechanisms. We discuss knowledge gaps and promising directions of future research.},

  abstract = {Based on recent findings in the literature, we developed a process-oriented conceptual model that integrates all three process groups of organic matter (OM) stabilization in soils namely (1) selective preservation of recalcitrant compounds, (2) spatial inaccessibility to decomposer organisms, and (3) interactions of OM with minerals and metal ions. The model concept relates the diverse stabilization mechanisms to active, intermediate, and passive pools. The formation of the passive pool is regarded as hierarchical structured co-action of various processes that are active under specific pedogenetic conditions. To evaluate the model, we used data of pool sizes and turnover times of soil OM fractions from horizons of two acid forest and two agricultural soils. Selective preservation of recalcitrant compounds is relevant in the active pool and particularly in soil horizons with high C contents. Biogenic aggregation preserves OM in the intermediate pool and is limited to topsoil horizons. Spatial inaccessibility due to the occlusion of OM in clay microstructures and due to the formation of hydrophobic surfaces stabilizes OM in the passive pool. If present, charcoal contributes to the passive pool mainly in topsoil horizons. The importance of organo-mineral interactions for OM stabilization in the passive pool is well-known and increases with soil depth. Hydrophobicity is particularly relevant in acid soils and in soils with considerable inputs of charcoal. We conclude that the stabilization potentials of soils are site- and horizon-specific. Furthermore, management affects key stabilization mechanisms. Tillage increases the importance of organo-mineral interactions for OM stabilization, and in Ap horizons with high microbial activity and C turnover, organo-mineral interactions can contribute to OM stabilization in the intermediate pool. The application of our model showed that we need a better understanding of processes causing spatial inaccessibility of OM to decomposers in the passive pool.},

This study is the first to investigate the in situ efficacy of biochar and biochar\textendash compost as Cu immobilizers, reducing Cu uptake by plants and increasing microbial abundance and activity, in a temperate vineyard topsoil (0\textendash 10 cm). After application of biochar, compost and biochar\textendash compost in April 2011, plant and soil samples were taken in November 2011, April 2012, August 2012, and November 2012. Similar amounts of exchangeable Cu fractions (CuDTPA) in all treatments showed that there was no significant effect on Cu immobilization in soil. In contrast, cover crops grown between vine rows were observed to take up a significant amount of Cu (38.7 mg Cu kg\`A1), reducing soil Cu concentrations over time. Treatments with biochar and/or compost initially increased total carbon, with compost and biochar\textendash compost additionally increasing extractable organic carbon in soil. Compost and biochar\textendash compost significantly increased microbial biomass, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), enzyme activities (phosphatase, arylsulfatase) and bacterial taxa abundances (Actinobacteria, a-Proteobacteria, b-Proteobacteria,Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes). A high abundance of gram+ Actinobacteria in all treatments suggested that they are adapted to heavy metals, likely due to their specific cell membrane structures. Additionally, each treatment was characterized by a specific microbial community composition. Compost and biochar\textendash compost increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes, while control and biochar increased Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes and Actinobacteria. In conclusion, biochar and/or compost were not viable Cu remediation options, but compost and biochar\textendash compost provided ecosystem services by reinforcing the microbial community.},

Urea application caused an 32\textendash 78\% increase in the specific respiratory activity (SRA) under wheat but caused an 11\textendash 50\% decrease during the maize season. Farmyard manure also resulted in a higher SRA under both crops but only at the higher application rate. Under wheat, microbial biomass C (MBC) decreased in urea-treated plots but showed a slight increase at the higher rate of FYM. During the maize season, MBC was higher under both urea (42\textendash 46\%) and FYM (36\textendash 47\%) treatments as compared to the control. Microbial biomass turnover rate was highest for FYM-32 (2.08), followed by FYM-16 and urea treatments (1.35\textendash 1.49); control plots showed a turnover rate of 0.82.

This study investigated the effects of long-term fertilization on the decomposition of 14C-labelled plant residues and their incorporation into soil organic matter (SOM) of different aggregate size fractions. Soils were collected from 0\textendash 10 cm in the Ap horizon of a long-term (since 1988) field experiment at Grossbeeren (Germany). The following four fertilization treatments were used: 1) without fertilization or manuring (Control), 2) nitrogen applied by mineral fertilizer (N), and 3) manure with low (M) and 4) high (2 M) application doses. Soils were incubated for 100 days at 20 8C, with or without 14C-labelled plant residue. The incorporation of 14C into three aggregate size fractions\textendash large macroaggregates (2\textendash 1 mm), small macroaggregates (1\textendash 0.25) and microaggregates ({$<$}0.25 mm)\textendash was analyzed.},

  abstract = {Soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources and its seasonal dynamics are poorly known. We aimed to determine the contribution of plant and soil organic matter (SOM) to size classes of DOC in a field experiment with C3 to C4 vegetation change on two soil types through different seasons. Stable isotope ratios of DOC size classes were measured using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled online to liquid chromatography\textendash isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LC-IRMS). SEC resolved DOC into three size classes: very high molecular weight/vHMW ({$>$} 10 kDa), high molecular weight/HMW (0.4\textendash 10 kDa), and low molecular weight/LMW ({$<$} 0.4 kDa). HMW DOC was most abundant in all seasons, soil types, and depths. In contrast, vHMW DOC was only seen postsnowmelt in upper 20 cm and was mainly (87 \AE{} 9\%) plantderived. Through all seasons, HMW and LMW DOC had less than 30\% recent plant contribution. Similar size range and source of DOC size classes and soil chloroform fumigation extracts suggest microbial origin of DOC. Thus, microbial SOM recycling is an important process in DOC production. We suggest that DOC molecules get partitioned manifold between soil solution and the mineral matrix (chromatography), thereby getting constantly decomposed, altered, or produced anew by soil microorganisms (reactive transport).},

Two P-deficient soils were amended with farmyard manure (FYM), poultry litter (PL) and biogenic waste compost (BWC) at 10~g\{\textbackslash thinspace\}dw\{\textbackslash thinspace\}kg-1 soil and incubated for 72~days. Soil samples were collected at days 0, 14, 28, 56 and 72 and analysed for microbial biomass C, N and P, 0.5~M NaHCO3 extractable P and activity of dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphomonoesterase. Soil P fractions were sequentially extracted in soil samples collected at days 0 and 72. All three amendments increased cumulative CO2 release, microbial biomass C, N and P and activity of dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphomonoesterase compared to unamended soils. The increase in microbial biomass C and N was highest with PL, whereas the greatest increase in microbial biomass P was induced with FYM. All three biomass indices showed the same temporal pattern, with the highest values on day 14 and the lowest on day 72. All amendments increased 0.5~M NaHCO3 extractable P concentrations with the smallest increase with BWC and the greatest with FYM, although more P was added with PL than with FYM. Available P concentrations decreased over time in the amended soils. Organic amendments increased the concentration of the labile P pools (resin and NaHCO3-P) and of NaOH-P, but had little effect on the concentrations of acid-soluble P pools and residual P except for increasing the concentration of organic P in the concentrated HCl pool. Resin P and NaHCO3-Pi pools decreased over time whereas NaOH-Pi and all organic P pools increased. It is concluded that organic amendments can provide P to plants and can stimulate the build-up of organic P forms in soils which may provide a long-term slow-release P source for plants and soil organisms.},

Recent results show that they also contribute significantly to soil organic matter (SOM) formation. We hypothesized that different molecular size classes of compounds in soil microbial biomass (SMB) have variable turnover time and in consequence influence SOM formation differentially. Here we used natural differences in carbon stable isotope signatures ({$\delta$}13C values) after C3-C4 vegetation change to track newly fixed C4 plant carbon into SMB molecular size classes. SMB was obtained by chloroform fumigation extraction (SFE) and {$\delta$}13C values of its size classes were measured using size exclusion chromatography coupled online to liquid chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (SEC-LC-IRMS). Resolved SMB was assigned to 5 size classes of 1800-9800, 800-1800, 380-800, 180-380 and 50-180Da respectively. The contribution of recent C4 plant carbon to size classes of SMB decreased with increasing molecular weight (MW). It ranged from 77{$\pm$}19\% in the lowest MW size class size class to 41{$\pm$}14\% in the highest MW size class in a sandy soil and from 59{$\pm$}18\% in the lowest MW size class to 8{$\pm$}15\% in the highest MW size class in a clayey soil. A decreasing carbon turnover of compounds in SMB extracts along a continuum of molecular size from small to large implies that low molecular weight microbial compounds are rapidly metabolized products that link to fast respiratory carbon fluxes, whereas high molecular weight ones could be products of microbial synthesis like structural compounds that have slower turnover rates and link to slower SOM formation. Our methods help avoid contamination of CFE extracts and the results help explain why SMB turnover is faster in CFE extracts when compared to calculations using membrane lipids (e.g. PLFA-based). \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Time dependent (13)C dilution patterns in microbial cellular fractions were used to calculate their turnover time. The turnover times of microbial biomolecules were found to vary: microbial RNA (19 h) and DNA (30 h) turned over fastest followed by chloroform fumigation extraction-derived soluble cell lysis products (14 days), while phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) had the slowest turnover (42 days). PLFA/NLFA (13)C analyses suggest that both mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal and saprophytic fungi are dominant in initial plant carbon uptake. In contrast, high initial (13)C enrichment in RNA hints at bacterial importance in initial C uptake due to the dominance of bacterial derived RNA in total extracts of soil RNA. To explain this discrepancy, we observed low renewal rate of bacterial lipids, which may therefore bias lipid fatty acid based interpretations of the role of bacteria in soil microbial food webs. Based on our findings, we question current assumptions regarding plant-microbe carbon flux and suggest that the rhizosphere bacterial contribution to plant assimilate uptake could be higher. This highlights the need for more detailed quantitative investigations with nucleic acid biomarkers to further validate these findings.},

  abstract = {Microbial contribution to the maintenance and turnover of soil organic matter is significant. Yet, we do not have a thorough understanding of how biochemical composition of soil microbial biomass is related to carbon turnover and persistence of different microbial components. Using a suite of state-of-the-art analytical techniques, we investigated the molecular characteristics of extractable microbial biomass and linked it to its carbon turnover time. A 13CO2 plant pulse labelling experiment was used to trace plant carbon into rhizosphere soil microbial biomass, which was obtained by chloroform fumigation extraction (CFE). 13C content in molecular size classes of extracted microbial compounds was analysed using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled online to high performance liquid chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (SEC-HPLC-IRMS). Molecular characterization of microbial compounds was performed using complementary approaches, namely SEC-HPLC coupled to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SEC-HPLC-FTIR) and electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). SEC-HPLC-FTIR suggests that mid to high molecular weight (MW) microbial compounds were richer in aliphatic CH bonds, carbohydrate-like compounds and possibly PO derivatives from phospholipids. On the contrary, the lower size range was characterized by more oxidised compounds with hydroxyl, carbonyl, ether and/or carboxyl groups. ESI-FT-ICR-MS suggests that microbial compounds were largely aliphatic and richer in N than the background detrital material. Both molecular characterization tools suggest that CFE derived microbial biomass was largely lipid, carbohydrate and protein derived. SEC-HPLC-IRMS analysis revealed that 13C enrichment decreased with increasing MW of microbial compounds and the turnover time was deduced as 12.8 {$\pm$} 0.6, 18.5 {$\pm$} 0.6 and 22.9 {$\pm$} 0.7 days for low, mid and high MW size classes, respectively. We conclude that low MW compounds represent the rapidly turned-over metabolite fraction of extractable soil microbial biomass consisting of organic acids, alcohols, amino acids and sugars; whereas, larger structural compounds are part of the cell envelope (likely membrane lipids, proteins or polysaccharides) with a much lower renewal rate. This relation of microbial carbon turnover to its molecular size, structure and composition thus highlights the significance of cellular biochemistry in determining the microbial contribution to soil carbon cycling and specifically soil organic matter formation.},

Despite several lines of observational evidence, there is a lack of consensus on whether higher fungal:bacterial (F:B) ratios directly cause higher soil carbon (C) storage. We employed RNA sequencing, protein profiling and isotope tracer techniques to evaluate whether differing F:B ratios are associated with differences in C storage. A mesocosm 13C labeled foliar litter decomposition experiment was performed in two soils that were similar in their physico-chemical properties but differed in microbial community structure, specifically their F:B ratio (determined by PLFA analyses, RNA sequencing and protein profiling; all three corroborating each other). Following litter addition, we observed a consistent increase in abundance of fungal phyla; and greater increases in the fungal dominated soil; implicating the role of fungi in litter decomposition. Litter derived 13C in respired CO2 was consistently lower, and residual 13C in bulk SOM was higher in high F:B soil demonstrating greater C storage potential in the F:B dominated soil. We conclude that in this soil system, the increased abundance of fungi in both soils and the altered C cycling patterns in the F:B dominated soils highlight the significant role of fungi in litter decomposition and indicate that F:B ratios are linked to higher C storage potential.},

  abstract = {Carbon (C) metabolism is at the core of ecosystem function. Decomposers play a critical role in this metabolism as they drive soil C cycle by mineralizing organic matter to CO(2). Their growth depends on the carbon-use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of growth over C uptake. By definition, high CUE promotes growth and possibly C stabilization in soils, while low CUE favors respiration. Despite the importance of this variable, flexibility in CUE for terrestrial decomposers is still poorly characterized and is not represented in most biogeochemical models. Here, we synthesize the theoretical and empirical basis of changes in CUE across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting common patterns and hypothesizing changes in CUE under future climates. Both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence from aquatic organisms indicate that CUE decreases as temperature increases and nutrient availability decreases. More limited evidence shows a similar sensitivity of CUE to temperature and nutrient availability in terrestrial decomposers. Increasing CUE with improved nutrient availability might explain observed declines in respiration from fertilized stands, while decreased CUE with increasing temperature and plant C : N ratios might decrease soil C storage. Current biogeochemical models could be improved by accounting for these CUE responses along environmental and stoichiometric gradients.},

Biological CUE is the fraction of C taken up allocated to biosynthesis. In soils and sediments, C storage depends also on abiotic processes, so the term C-storage efficiency (CSE) can be used.

Second, we identify general CUE patterns; for example, the actual CUE increases with improving growth conditions, and apparent CUE decreases with increasing turnover. We then synthesize {$>$}\,5000\,CUE estimates showing that CUE decreases with increasing biological and ecological organization \textendash{} from unicellular to multicellular organisms and from individuals to ecosystems.

This research was conducted to study the effect of cultivation on the distribution of soil macro- and microaggregates as related to changes in soil organic matter content in a Typic Haplustoll, located in central Cordoba, the principal peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) growing area of Argentina. Samples were taken from A or Ap horizons at (1) an undisturbed and (2) a cultivated site for determination of the aggregate fractions by the wet sieving method. The mineral associated organic carbon (MOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC), in soils and their aggregates, were separated by dispersion and sieving procedures. Carbohydrate content in soil and in aggregate fractions was determined by dilute acid (CHda) and hot water (CHhw) extraction, whereas humic (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) were extracted by the NaOH method. The results indicated that the total macroaggregates ({$>$}250 {$\mu$}m) content was 1.7 times lower in the cultivated than in the undisturbed soil. The large macroaggregates (2800\textendash 2000 {$\mu$}m) were the most affected, decreasing a 92\% due to cultivation compared with undisturbed. In contrast, the microaggregate (250\textendash 53 {$\mu$}m) content was twice that high in the cultivated than in the undisturbed soil. The concentrations of OC, POC, CHda, CHhw were all reduced substantially by cultivation, with the microaggregates showing an almost complete loss of its POC content. The destruction of these transient organic cementing agents was assumed to have contributed to the collapse of the macroaggregates. This has resulted in exposure of POC, making it more available to rapid oxidation and microbial attack. There were indications suggesting POC and CHhw contents to be valuable as indicators of soil structure degradation due to exhaustive cultivation practices. Although it is well know that humic substances are chemically and structurally much more stable than nonhumic substances but our results showed a surprising decrease humic substances under continuous cultivation.},

Carbon forms and microbial biomass have been measured by dichromate oxidation and fumigation-extraction methods, respectively. Dehydrogenase activity has been tested using INT (p-Iodonitrotetrazolium violet) as substrate. The results showed that organic amendment increased soil microbial biomass and its activity which were strictly related to pyrolytic mineralization and humification indices (N/O, B/E3). Mineral fertilization caused a greater alteration of native soil organic matter than the organic amendments, in that a high release of WSOC and relatively large amounts of aliphatic pyrolytic products, were observed.

We sampled soils at three different European sites located in Mediterranean (Italy) and continental (Switzerland) regions under conventional and organic management. The Mediterranean sites are here called CVI and LSI and the continental one DOK. The main difference between the two management systems (ORG and CONV) at all sites was the amount of organic fertilizer yearly added into the soil: in the ORG systems 2.2\textendash 2.5 Mg C year\`A1 were added as organic fertilizer, while in the CONV systems only mineral fertilizers were used. Moreover, the crop rotation was different between the two management systems at first two sites (7 years-crop vs. 4 yearscrop rotation), while at DOK site a 7 years-crop rotation was adopted in both managements. In these soils we analyzed C mineralization rate expressed as percentage of mineralized C in a 90-day incubation with respect to soil total organic C (qM), the content of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC), its initial composition by fluorescence spectroscopy (humification index \textendash{} HIX) and its biodegradability (DWEOC). The Mediterranean basic soil accumulated more organic C showing a more complex WEOC than continental acid soil. Moreover, among management practices the crop rotation seemed to be one of the most important factor affecting WEOC properties and C mineralization rate (qM). In particular the highest qM and WEOC content were observed in both systems with 7 years-crop rotation including pasture, such as alfalfa or grass clover, according to the order ORG(DOK) = CONV(DOK) {$>$} ORG(LSI) {$>$} ORG(CVI). With respect to the effect of the management systems on C mineralization rate and WEOC properties, significant differences of WEOC content were observed between ORG and CONV soils at all sites (5.7 vs. 7.7; 14.5 vs. 17.9; 6.8 vs. 13.5 at CVI, DOK and LSI, respectively), whereas qM and HIX were significantly different only at the Mediterranean sites (qM: 4.4 vs. 5.8 and 6.6 vs. 8.2; HIX: 9.4 vs. 13.7 and 3.4 vs. 13.6 at CVI and LSI, respectively). Therefore, we can conclude that WEOC content is not a generally applicable parameter to distinguish conventionally from organically managed soils as responsible for C mineralization. Specific cropping systems, soil properties and climate conditions should be considered as important factors affecting mineralization process and WEOC properties.},

In this laboratory study fresh leaf litter from two tree species (Melia azedarach, Castanea sativa) and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) trash containing ash alkalinities of 288, 141 and 33~mmolc kg-1 respectively, were mixed at three different rates (4, 16, 32~mg g-1) with acidic topsoil from a Ultic Palexeralf and incubated at 90\% WHC and at 25\textdegree C for 20~d while monitoring CO2-evolution. Treatment effects were assessed by measuring changes in pH, acid buffering curves and exchangeable cations before and after incubation. Furthermore, soluble organic compounds, mineral N-forms were determined in soil extracts. Immediately after mixing, up to 50\% of the added alkalinity was available for acid neutralisation. After incubation, acid neutralisation capacity at pH~4 (ANCpH4) and the pH of the soils with the two higher amendment rates had increased in all treatments. The changes were most pronounced in the Melia amended soils, followed by Castanea and sugarcane and reflected the added amounts of ash alkalinity. In all treatments, soil respiration increased with amendment rate and was closely related to a decline in soluble organic carbon during incubation. Together with the shift from stronger to weaker acidity observed after incubation, this is evidence for the microbial decarboxylation of soluble organic anions.},

  abstract = {In soils, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is probably the most bioavailable fraction of soil organic matter, since all microbial uptake mechanisms require a water environment. Bioavailability describes the potential of microorganisms to interact with DOM. It is a prerequisite for biodegradation and can be restricted, if DOM is present in small pores or within soil aggregates and therefore not accessible for microorganisms. DOM biodegradation is defined as the utilisation of organic compounds by soil microorganisms quantified by the disappearance of DOM or O2 or by the evolution of CO2. The controlling factors for DOM biodegradability can be divided into three groups, namely, intrinsic DOM quality parameters, soil and solution parameters and external factors. DOM characteristics that generally enhance its biodegradability are high contents of carbohydrates, organic acids and proteins for which the hydrophilic neutral fraction seems to be a good estimate. In contrast, aromatic and hydrophobic structures that can also be assessed by UV absorbance decrease DOM biodegradability, either due to their recalcitrance or due to inhibiting effects on enzyme activity. Effects of solution parameters such as Al, Fe, Ca and heavy metal concentrations on DOM biodegradability have been documented in various studies, however with different, sometimes conflicting results. Inhibitory effects of metals are generally attributed to toxicity of the organic complexes or the free metal ions. In contrast, the enhanced degradability observed in the presence of metal ions may be due to flocculation, as larger structures will provide better attachment for microbial colonies. As degradation is dependent on microbial activity, the composition and density of the microbial population used in the degradation studies also influence biodegradation. Site-specific factors, such as vegetation, land use and seasonality of meteorological parameters control DOM composition and soil and soil solution properties and therefore also affect its biodegradability.},

We conducted a study to determine the effects of long-term addition of organic and inorganic fertiliser amendments at low rates on soil chemical and biological properties. Surface soil samples were taken from an experimental field site near Cologne, Germany in summer 2000. At this site, five different treatments were established in 1969: mineral fertiliser (NPK), crop residues removed (mineral only); mineral fertiliser with crop residues; manure 5.2 t ha21 yr21; sewage sludge 7.6 t ha21 yr21 or straw 4.0 t ha21 yr21 with 10 kg N as CaCN2 t straw21. The organic amendments increased the Corg content of the soil but had no significant effect on the dissolved organic C (DOC) content. The C/N ratio was highest in the straw treatment and lowest in the mineral only treatment. Of the enzymes studied, only protease activity was affected by the different amendments. It was highest after sewage amendment and lowest in the mineral only treatment. The ratios of Gram \th{} to Gram 2 bacteria and of bacteria to fungi, as determined by signature phospholipid fatty acids, were higher in the organic treatments than in the inorganic treatments. The community structure of bacteria and eukaryotic microorganisms was assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and redundancy discriminate analyses of the DGGE banding patterns. While the bacterial community structure was affected by the treatments this was not the case for the eukaryotes. Bacterial and eukaryotic community structures were significantly affected by Corg content and C/N ratio.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, the selective preservation of certain recalcitrant organic compounds and the formation of recalcitrant humic substances have been regarded as an important mechanism for soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization. Based on a critical overview of available methods and on results from a cooperative research program, this paper evaluates how relevant recalcitrance is for the long-term stabilization of SOM or its fractions. Methodologically, recalcitrance is difficult to assess, since the persistence of certain SOM fractions or specific compounds may also be caused by other stabilization mechanisms, such as physical protection or chemical interactions with mineral surfaces. If only free particulate SOM obtained from density fractionation is considered, it rarely reaches ages exceeding 50 y. Older light particles have often been identified as charred plant residues or as fossil C. The degradability of the readily bioavailable dissolved or water-extractable OM fraction is often negatively correlated with its content in aromatic compounds, which therefore has been associated with recalcitrance. But in subsoils, dissolved organic matter aromaticity and biodegradability both are very low, indicating that other factors or compounds limit its degradation. Among the investigated specific compounds, lignin, lipids, and their derivatives have mean turnover times faster or similar as that of bulk SOM. Only a small fraction of the lignin inputs seems to persist in soils and is mainly found in the fine textural size fraction ({$<$}20 \textmu m), indicating physico-chemical stabilization. Compound-specific analysis of 13C : 12C ratios of SOM pyrolysis products in soils with C3-C4 crop changes revealed no compounds with mean residence times of {$>$} 40\textendash 50 y, unless fossil C was present in substantial amounts, as at a site exposed to lignite inputs in the past. Here, turnover of pyrolysis products seemed to be much longer, even for those attributed to carbohydrates or proteins. Apparently, fossil C from lignite coal is also utilized by soil organisms, which is further evidenced by low 14C concentrations in microbial phospholipid fatty acids from this site. Also, black C from charred plant materials was susceptible to microbial degradation in a short-term (60 d) and a long-term (2 y) incubation experiment. This degradation was enhanced, when glucose was supplied as an easily available microbial substrate. Similarly, SOM mineralization in many soils generally increased after addition of carbohydrates, amino acids, or simple organic acids, thus indicating that stability may also be caused by substrate limitations. It is concluded that the presented results do not provide much evidence that the selective preservation of recalcitrant primary biogenic compounds is a major SOM-stabilization mechanism. Old SOM fractions with slow turnover rates were generally only found in association with soil minerals. The only not mineral-associated SOM components that may be persistent in soils appear to be black and fossil C.},

Samples were either non-sterile, sterilised by g-irradiation or reinoculated after sterilisation. Incubations were performed at three temperatures: 5, 20 and 35 8C for 12 days with continuous CO2-monitoring.

DOC quality was assessed by ultra-\textregistered ltration, UV-absorbance, Cu-complexation capacity and biodegradability. In the sterile samples, DOC-concentrations were hardly affected by incubation temperature and among the quality parameters, only the UV-absorbance of DOC decreased with increasing incubation temperature in all size fractions. In the reinoculated and non-sterile samples, DOC-concentrations decreased strongly with increasing incubation temperature. This was closely related to respiration activity and accompanied by increases in Cu-complexation capacity and biodegradability.

In an incubation experiment, we investigated (i) the effect of plant material addition from selected monocot and dicot species on soil organic C (SOC), carbohydrate composition, fungal and total microbial biomass, and aggregation of an Oxisol; and (ii) the relationship among these properties and C mineralization patterns. The experiment was carried out at 25 C for 180 d after addition of 11 plant materials (4 g C kg \`A1 soil) and a control (no plant material added). Mineralization of C during the incubation was described considering two pools of C (labile and non-labile) using a first-order plus linear fitting. Compared to the control, corn materials showed larger pentose input, greater mineralization rates for the non-labile C pool (k), greater soil pentose content (xylose \th{} arabinose) and larger mean weight diameter of soil water-stable aggre-gates at 180 d of incubation. These effects were independent of changes in SOC content, suggesting that total C accrual and macroaggregation may be decoupled processes in this Oxisol. Our results support the hypothesis that the non-labile plant C pool contributes to the long-lasting stability of macroaggregates of this Oxisol and that this effect is mediated by plant and soil pentoses. We propose that plant pentose content and the decomposition rate of the slow pool (k) are useful parameters for the prediction of plant effects on aggregation dynamics of Oxisols and the selection of soil conservation practices.},

  abstract = {A broader knowledge of the contribution of carbon (C) released by plant roots (exudates) to soil is a prerequisite for optimizing the management of organic matter in arable soils. This is the first study to show the contribution of constantly applied C-13-labelled maize and wheat exudates to water extractable organic carbon (WEOC), microbial biomass-C (MB-C), and CO2-C evolution during a 25-day incubation of agricultural soil material. The CO2-C evolution and respective delta C-13 values were measured daily. The WEOC and MB-C contents were determined weekly and a newly developed method for determining delta C-13 values in soil extracts was applied. Around 36\% of exudate-C of both plants was recovered after the incubation, in the order WEOC {$<$} MB-C {$<$} CO2-C for maize and MB-C {$<$} WEOC {$<$} CO2-C for wheat. Around 64\% of added exudate-C was not retrieved with the methods used here. Our results suggest that great amounts of exudates became stabilized in non-water extractable organic fractions. The amounts of MB-C stayed relatively constant over time despite a continuous exudate-C supply, which is the prerequisite for a growing microbial population. A lack of mineral nutrients might have limited microbial growth. The CO2-C mineralization rate declined during the incubation and this was probably caused by a shift in the microbial community structure. Consequently, incoming WEOC was left in the soil solution leading to rising WEOC amounts over time. In the exudate-treated soil additional amounts of soil-derived WEOC (up to 110 mu g g(-1)) and MB-C (up to 60 mu g g(-1)) relative to the control were determined. We suggest therefore that positive priming effects (i.e. accelerated turnover of soil organic matter due to the addition of organic substrates) can be explained by exchange processes between charged, soluble C-components and the soil matrix. As a result of this exchange, soil-derived WEOC becomes available for mineralization.},

Exact quantitative data concerning the contribution of exudates to soil C pools are still missing.

The contribution of exudate C to water-extractable organic C (WEOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), and CO2-C evolution was investigated during a 74 d incubation. The WEOC, MBC, and CO2-C concentrations and the respective {$\delta$}13C values were determined regularly. In both soils, significant incorporation of artificial-exudate-derived C was observed in the WEOC and MBC pool and in CO2-C. Up to approx. 50\% of the exudate-C amounts added were recovered in the order WEOC {$<<$} MBC {$<$} CO2-C in both soils at the end of the incubation. Newly built microbial biomass consisted mainly of exudates, which substituted soil-derived C. Correspondingly, the CO2-C evolved from exudate-treated soils relative to the controls was dominated by exudate C, showing a preferential mineralization of this substrate. Our results suggest that the remaining 50\% of the exudate C added became stabilized in non-water-extractable organic fractions. This assumption was supported by the determination of the total organic C in the soils on the second-last sampling towards the end of the incubation. In the exudate-treated soils, significantly more soil-derived C compared to the controls was found in the WEOC on almost all samplings and in the MBC on the first sampling. This material might have derived from exchange processes between the added exudate and the soil matrix. This study showed that easily available substrates can be stabilized in soil at least in the short term.},

Among chemical parameters, electrical conductivity was high in SF, and soil nutrients (N, P, K, S, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn) were well above the critical limits of deficiency in all the systems. Soil parameters were integrated into soil quality indices (SQIs) by unscreened transformation and principal component analysis (PCA).

Here we conduct a microcosm experiment to quantify how interactions among wood-decay basidiomycete fungi alter growth, respiration and CUE across a temperature and nitrogen gradient. We show that species interactions induced consistent declines in CUE, regardless of abiotic conditions. Multispecies communities exhibited reductions in CUE of up to 25\% relative to individual CUE, with this biotic effect being greater than the observed variation attributable to abiotic conditions.

  abstract = {We examined relationships between the pore structure of microaggregates and the protection of organic matter (OM) within that structure. By using ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) before and after combustion of microaggregates at 350 \textdegree C, we took advantage of differences in X-ray scattering contrast among soil minerals, OM, and air to evaluate the distribution of the total- and OM-filled porosity within microaggregates (53\textendash 250 lm in diameter). Systematic changes in microaggregate structure were observed for long-term field manipulations of land use (a chronosequence of tallgrass prairie restorations) and agricultural management (conventional tillage versus no-till at two levels of nitrogen fertilization). Our results imply that OM preservation arose from the evolution of the architectural system of microaggregates during their formation and stabilization. Soils and treatments with increasing OM in microaggregates were associated with encapsulation of colloidal OM by minerals, thereby creating protected OM-filled pores at the submicron scale within the microaggregate structure. For example, in the prairie chronosequence, microaggregates from the cultivated soil had the lowest concentration of OM, but 75\% of the OM that had survived cultivation was in OM-filled pores. Following restoration, the concentration of OM in microaggregates increased rapidly, but the proportion of OM in OM-filled pores declined initially and then increased over time until 90\% of the OM was in OM-filled pores. OM totally encapsulated within the pore structure can create spatial and kinetic constraints on microbial access to and degradation of OM. Encapsulation of OM increases the capacity for its protection relative to sorption on mineral surfaces, and comparison of its extent among treatments suggests important feedback loops. The use of USAXS, which has not previously been applied to the study of soil aggregate structures and the distribution of OM within those structures, provided new information on the mechanisms of OM protection in soil microaggregates, and insights relevant to strategies for enhancing carbon-sequestration in soil through changes in agricultural management practices and land use.},

Despite extensive research on effects of rotation- and cover-crops on soil health, variable outcomes remain a problem. Using sandy clay loam and loam fields with known SBCN infestation, we tested how two each of oilseed (`Defender' and `Tillage'), mustard (`Pacific Gold' and `Ida Gold'), sugar beet (`B-18RR4N' and `B-10RR34') and soybean (`92Y80' and `92M91'), and a maize (`P9910R') variety affect nematode community and soil food web in the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. Each treatment (crop) was replicated six times. Maize is a non-host and Defender and Pacific Gold are poor hosts for SBCN. Nematode community composition at intervals during growing seasons and soil physiochemical properties at the end of year 1 were measured. The crops had no effect on nematodes. Nematode abundance and community indices varied by sampling time, growing season and/or soil type. Principal component analysis showed that the crops distinctly separated by soil type and only a few nematode community indices and/or soil physiochemical parameters overlapped with crop. Soil food web analysis showed depleted and degraded conditions in the sandy loam soil and disturbed and approaching enrichment in the loam soil. The study suggests a roadmap to get to agrobiologically suitable soil conditions to meet industry priorities for healthy soils.},

  abstract = {Land use change can affect terrestrial C stocks, resulting in increased CO2 flux from soil to the atmosphere. In Africa, conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural lands is the most common land use change. This study investigated the effects of six land use types occurring in Mt. Kilimanjaro ecosystems i.e. (1) lower montane forest (2) grassland and (3) savannah (natural ecosystems) (4) Chagga homegardens (semi-natural ecosystem) and (5) maize fields and (6) coffee plantation (agroecosystems) on microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dynamics of 14C labelled glucose added into soil. Decomposition of 14C labelled glucose and its incorporation into microbial biomass in surface soils (0e10 and 10e20 cm) were determined. MBC decreased significantly with increased intensity of land use. Mineralization of the 14C labelled glucose occurred in two phases with contrasting rates: 0e10 days (6e18\% of 14C d\`A1) and 15 e65 days ({$<$}0.1\% of 14C d\`A1). Land use intensification in agroecosystems led to an average increase of glucose decomposition of 14\%. The decay rates of the labile C pool in intensively used agricultural lands were up to three times higher compared to natural ecosystems. The incorporation of 14C glucose into microorganisms ranged between 1 and 7\% of 14C input in all soils, and was highest in savannah. Agricultural intensification decreased C content in soil through increased mineralization of organic substances and negatively impacted the upper soil layer more compared to the lower one. Based on these results we conclude that semi-natural ecosystems (e.g. Chagga homegardens) are more sustainable in Mt. Kilimanjaro ecosystems compared to intensive agroecosystems.},

Kilimanjaro region: (1) montane forest, (2) savannah (3) maize fields and (4) Chagga homegardens were used in laboratory incubations to assess the effects of landuse changes on soil quality. Soil organic matter mineralization and the following microbial parameters: microbial biomass C, mineralization quotient, metabolic quotient and activities of four enzymes: {$\beta$}-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, phosphatase and chitinase were determined. Microbial biomass C content, {$\beta$}-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase and chitinase activities were higher in natural systems compared to agricultural soils. High phosphatase activity observed in all land use types reflected strong phosphorus limitation in andic soils of the Mt. Kilimanjaro region. Chitinase activity in montane forest soils was 3 times higher than in Chagga homegardens. Mineralization quotient and cellobiohydrolase activity best exhibited the effect of land-use changes on soil quality in the Mt. Kilimanjaro region. Cellobiohydrolase activity was up to 3 times higher under natural ecosystems compared to agroecosystems. A high percentage of microbial biomass C content in total organic C and low metabolic quotient were observed in Chagga homegarden soils. Soil enzymes (especially cellobiohydrolase) best distinguished between natural and agricultural ecosystems, and are therefore useful for monitoring changes in soil quality. In conclusion, the measured microbial parameters clearly show that the microbial organisms in traditional Chagga homegardens system have high substrate use efficiency. This demonstrates that traditional agroforestry systems promotes soil fertility and are more suitable for agricultural production in the tropics compared to monocropping systems like maize plantations.},

Multiple regression models for both regions show that SOC and SON, as well as C/N ratios, increase with decreasing temperatures and increasing precipitation, trends also noted in soil data organized by Holdridge life zones. The calculated difference between natural and cultivated soils in India revealed that the greatest absolute SOC and SON losses occurred in regions of low temperatures and high precipitation, while the C/N ratio decreased during cultivation only with decreasing temperature. In India, the fractional loss of SOC relative to undisturbed soils increases with decreasing temperature whereas, in the Great Plains, it increases with increasing precipitation. Also, the fractional loss of SOC increased in India with increasing amounts of original C, whereas no relationship between fractional loss and original C was noted for the Great Plains. The differential response of each region to cultivation is hypothesized to be due to differences in both climate and management practices (crop cycles, fertilization). These findings suggest that estimates of soil C loss due to cultivation should be based on an array of factors, and that it is unlikely that a constant relative C loss occurs in any region.},

Previous studies have shown that during SOM formation no new compound classes are formed and that it consists basically of plant- and microorganism-derived materials. However, little data on the contribution from microbial sources are available. Therefore, we investigated previously in a model study the fate of C from 13C-labelled Gram-negative bacteria in soil (Kindler, R., Miltner, A. Richnow, H.H., K\"astner, M., 2006. Fate of gram negative bacterial biomass in soil \textendash{} mineralization and contribution to SOM. Soil Biology and Biochemistry 38, 2860\textendash 2870) and showed that 44\% of the bulk 13C remained in the soil. Here we present the corresponding data on the fate of amino acids hydrolysed from proteins, which are the most abundant components of microbial biomass. After 224days incubation, the label in the total amino acids in the soil amended with 13C-labelled cells decreased only to {$>$}95\%. The total amino acids therefore clearly showed a lower turnover than the bulk 13C and a surprisingly stable concentration. Proteins therefore have to be considered as being stabilised in soil in dead, non-extractable biomass or cell fragments by known general stabilisation mechanisms. The label in the amino acids in a fraction highly enriched in living microbial biomass decreased to a greater extent, i.e. to 25\% of the initially added amount. The amino acids removed from this fraction were redistributed via the microbial food web to non-living SOM. All amino acids in the microbial biomass were degraded at similar rates without a change in isotopic signature. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the soils were very similar and indicate that the residues of the degraded microbial biomass were very similar to those of the SOM and are a significant source for the formation of the SOM.},

  abstract = {Proper management of soil organic matter (SOM) is needed for maintaining soil fertility and for mitigation of the global increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and should be informed by knowledge about the sources, spatial organisation and stabilisation processes of SOM. Recently, microbial biomass residues (i. e. necromass) have been identified as a significant source of SOM. Here, we propose that cell wall envelopes of bacteria and fungi are stabilised in soil and contribute significantly to small-particulate SOM formation. This hypothesis is based on the mass balance of a soil incubation experiment with 13C-labelled bacterial cells and on the visualisation of the microbial residues by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At the end of a 224-day incubation, 50\% of the biomass-derived C remained in the soil, mainly in the non-living part of SOM (40\% of the added biomass C). SEM micrographs only rarely showed intact cells. Instead, organic patchy fragments of 200-500 nm size were abundant and these fragments were associated with all stages of cell envelope decay and fragmentation. Similar fragments, developed on initially clean and sterile in situ microcosms during exposure to groundwater, provide clear evidence for their formation during microbial growth and surface colonisation. Microbial cell envelope fragments thus contribute significantly to SOM formation. This origin and the related macromolecular architecture of SOM are consistent with most observations on SOM, including the abundance of microbial-derived biomarkers, the low C/N ratio, the water repellency and the stabilisation of biomolecules, which in theory should be easily degradable. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

For 1 yr in a field station trial in Davis, CA, these treatments were compared: no-tillage + continuous cropping, no-tillage + fallow, standard tillage + continuous cropping, and standard tillage + fallow. The continuous cropping treatment consisted of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)/sorghum-sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]/garbanzo (Cicer arietinum L.)/cowpea cover crop [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walpers ssp. unguiculata]. The fallow rotation omitted the sorghum-sudangrass and cowpea cover crops. No-tillage + continuous cropping resulted in significant changes in the surface layer (0-5 cm): higher microbial biomass C, more fungi as indicated by ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acid analysis, and higher soil NO 3 - in summer, and higher pH, soluble K +, and Olsen P at the end of the experiment. At lower depths (5-15 and 15-30 cm), few differences were observed. Total soil C (at 0-30 cm) was least with standard tillage + fallow, the typical management practice in the region. The soil food web, as indicated by the nematodes, did not become more complex with no-tillage + continuous cropping, contrary to expectations, possibly because higher trophic level nematodes had been eliminated after decades of cultivation. The bacterial decomposition pathway dominated the surface layer in all treatments, but, with no-tillage, opportunistic (colonizer-persistent Group 1) bacterial feeders greatly decreased with depth. Plant productivity, except for weeds, was reduced by no-tillage, especially in the garbanzo crop. By decreasing disturbance and increasing fungi, no-tillage + continuous cropping appears to have accelerated soil C storage but management alterations are needed to produce higher crop biomass in this Mediterranean-type climate. \textcopyright Soil Science Society of America.},

Further progress is problematic because of difficulties in partitioning total soil respiration (RS) into its components soil heterotrophic respiration (RH) and soil autotrophic respiration (RA) in undisturbed ecosystems. To overcome this problem, we used an improved natural abundance of 13C technique to partition RS into RH and RA at one and six months after irrigation and addition of nitrogen fertiliser treatments was imposed in a grassland ecosystem.},

The agronomic history of the analyzed soils, which derived from a medium-term (11 yr) field experiment located in NW Italy, represents typical managements of maize for this region. The area is characterized by highly intensive agriculture, with consequent risks to soil degradation that could be limited by the efficient utilization of organic inputs and by recycling within cropping systems, the large amounts of manure that are produced from the many animal breeding farms in this region. We used a combination of both different chemical (soil organic C and total N) and biochemical indicators (potential soil respiration, potentially mineralizable N (PMN) and potential soil microbial biomass (SMB)).

The aim of this study was to identify the impacts of forest conversion to rubber plantations on soil microorganisms, using a space for time substitution design. Soil microbial communities from natural forests, young rubber and mature rubber plantations were investigated using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Microbial PLFA biomass of all functional groups including actinomycete, arbuscular mycorrhiza, fungi, bacteria and protozoa was lower in rubber plantations as compared to natural forests. This was true for young rubber and mature rubber plantations tested in both dry and wet seasons. The composition of microbial communities differed between natural forests, young rubber and mature rubber plantations. Changes in microbial community composition were strongly correlated with pH, which was lower in mature rubber plantations than in natural forests and young rubber plantations. In addition, our results showed that the variation in soil microbial community composition was strongly affected by seasonality, with higher PLFA biomass recorded in the dry season than in the wet season. The low soil microbial biomass in rubber plantations has long term implications regarding the soil health of rubber plantations.},

We investigated the accumulation patterns of proteinogenic amino acids associated with minerals dominated by permanently negative charges (primary silica minerals) and related these to vegetative and belowground microbial succession during soil ecosystem development. Positively-charged amino acids (arginine, lysine, histidine), extracted from whole soil pool using 6 M HCl, showed clear patterns of accumulation, increasing \textasciitilde 65\% during 4010 years of development, while negatively charged amino acids (glutamic acid, aspartic acid) decreased \textasciitilde 13\%. In the mineral associated sub-pool, positively charged amino acids were approximately \textasciitilde 431\% more enriched, while negatively charged amino acids were \textasciitilde 38\% depleted as compared to the whole soil pool. The multivariate ordination of soil bacterial community structure based on a 16s ribosomal RNA gene analysis and that of the aboveground plant community structure predicted 71\% (p {$<$} 0.0001) and 66\% (p {$<$} 0.0001) of the amino acid dynamics, respectively, during soil ecosystem development. Ala-rich Actinobacteria abundance declined with the year of development, concomitant with the decrease of Ala content in soil (r 2 = 0.82, p = 0.0019). His-rich Acidobacteria and His in soil both increased with the year of development (r 2 = 0.92, p = 0.0022). In support of the main hypothesis, the relative distribution of proteinogenic amino acids changed during pedogenesis with evidence indicating that biological communities and minerals play roles as source and sink of OM in soil, respectively.},

We labeled the microbial biomass with 13C-glucose and followed the microbial 13C turnover into different SOM pools under the influence of three plant amendments (mature wheat, immature wheat, and vetch) in a laboratory incubation experiment using a soil with two different contents of organic C (0.9 and 1.3 \%) owing to different soil management. At the end of incubation, more labeled glucose C was assimilated into microbial biomass in amended samples compared to an unamended control. The addition of plant residues also caused a positive priming effect, enhancing mineralization of soil organic C, which led to overall less glucose-derived C being incorporated into soil C pools. This was more pronounced in the soil with lower soil organic C content. Recovery of microbial C as recalcitrant C ranged between 6.0 and 7.1 \%, with no significant effect of initial SOM content and addition of plant materials. Although the short-term fate of C present in microbial biomass was clearly affected by residue additions and initial native SOM, the extent to which it was stabilized as recalcitrant C during this time was not affected and must therefore be controlled by other factors than soil amendments and land management.},

However, most studies have considered soil biota as a black box or focussed on specific groups, whereas little is known about entire soil networks. Here we show that during the course of nature restoration on abandoned arable land a compositional shift in soil biota, preceded by tightening of the belowground networks, corresponds with enhanced efficiency of carbon uptake. In mid- and long-term abandoned field soil, carbon uptake by fungi increases without an increase in fungal biomass or shift in bacterial-to-fungal ratio. The implication of our findings is that during nature restoration the efficiency of nutrient cycling and carbon uptake can increase by a shift in fungal composition and/or fungal activity. Therefore, we propose that relationships between soil food web structure and carbon cycling in soils need to be reconsidered.},

  abstract = {Soil moisture strongly affects the dynamics of soil organic matter and is an important environmental variable in all models predicting changes in soil carbon stocks from site to global scales. Despite this, the mechanisms determining the response of heterotrophic soil respiration to soil moisture remain poorly quantified, being represented in most current carbon cycle models as simple empirical functions. With the aim of providing an overview and new insights into the mechanisms involved, here we review the observations and theory behind the respiration-moisture relationship. We start by calculating best estimates of average empirical relationships using published data and comparing the results for contrasting soil types. The theoretical linkages between substrate and gas diffusivity in soil pores and heterotrophic respiration are then explored as a function of temperature and textural properties. Based on this theoretical model we interpret the variability of moisture effects observed in previous empirical studies. Transient CO2 effluxemoisture relationships are discussed next, reviewing the theory and models developed in the last years with particular emphasis on the `Birch effect'. We continue by giving an overview of recent pore-scale models and consider how these can be used to gain a more mechanistic understanding of carbon storage and stabilization in variably saturated soils. From this review we conclude that current empirical models are useful but limited approximations, with questionable predictive capacity. Significant efforts are still necessary to represent the full range of soil moisture responses in a unifying model with a sound theoretical basis that can help identify common underlying processes. Equations present here, combining diffusion, texture and substrate to model respiration, are a step forward in this direction.},

However, it is likely that many important microbial processes occur in spatially segregated microenvironments in the soil leading to a microscale biogeography. This study attempts to localize specific microbial populations to different fractions or compartments within the soil matrix. Microbial populations associated with macroaggregates and inner- versus total-microaggregates of three diverse soils were characterized using culture-independent, molecular methods. Despite their relative paucity in most surveys of soil diversity, representatives of Gemmatimonadetes and Actinobacteria subdivision Rubrobacteridae were found to be highly abundant in inner-microaggregates of most soils analyzed. By contrast, clones affiliated with Acidobacteria were found to be relatively enriched in libraries derived from macroaggregate fractions of nearly all soils, but poorly represented in inner-microaggregate fractions. Based upon analysis of 16S rRNA, active community members within microaggregates of a Georgian Ultisol were comprised largely of Gemmatimonadetes and Rubrobacteridae, while within microaggregates of a Nebraska Mollisol, Rubrobacteridae and Alphaproteobacteria were the predominant active bacterial lineages. This work suggests that microaggregates represent a unique microenvironment that selects for specific microbial lineages across disparate soils.},

  abstract = {Soil carbon is a large component of the global carbon cycle and its management can significantly affect the atmospheric CO2 concentration. An important management issue is the extent of soil carbon (C) release when forest is converted to agricultural land. We reviewed the literature to assess changes in soil C upon conversion of forests to agricultural land. Analyses are confounded by changes in soil bulk density upon land-use change, with agricultural soils on average having 13\% higher bulk density. Consistent with earlier reviews, we found that conversion of forest to cultivated land led to an average loss of approximately 30\% of soil C. When we restricted our analysis to studies that had used appropriate corrections for changes in bulk density, soil C loss was 22\%. When, from all the studies compiled, we considered only studies reporting both soil C and nitrogen (N), average losses of C and N were 24\% and 15\%, respectively, hence showing a decrease in the average C : N ratio. The magnitude of these changes in the C : N ratio did not correlate with either C or N changes. When considering the transition from forest to pasture, there was no significant change in either soil C or N, even though reported changes in soil C ranged from -50\% to +160\%. Among studies that reported changes in soil N as well as soil C, C : N ratios both increased and decreased, with trends depending on changes in system N. Systems with increasing soil N generally had decreased C : N ratios, whereas systems with decreasing soil N had increased C : N ratios. Our survey confirmed earlier findings that conversion of forest to cropland generally leads to a loss of soil carbon, although the magnitude of change might have been inflated in many studies by the confounding influence of bulk-density changes. In contrast, conversion of forest to uncultivated grazing land did not, on average, lead to loss of soil carbon, although individual sites may lose or gain soil C, depending on specific circumstances, such as application of fertiliser or retention or removal of plant residues.},

Microbial populations and functional diversity are greatly influenced by quantity and quality of crop residue and other incorporate organic amendments. This study investigated the effect of cover crops (rye or a mixture of rye-vetch) and compost on soil microflora and microfauna under an organic tomato production system. Each cover crop treatment was used in conjunction with or without compost in a split-plot experimental design. Data on soil respiration, microbial biomass, metabolic quotient, and nematode populations were measured at the end of the growing season. Metabolic characteristics of the soil microbial community were determined using 31 C substrates on Biolog-EcoPlate???. Community level physiological profile (CLPP) was assessed by calculating average well color development (AWCD), richness (S), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H), and evenness (E). Effect of compost was more pronounced on soil respiration than cover crop treatment. Highest microbial biomass was found in the soils amended with rye and compost (195-210??ggdrysoil -1). Regression analysis between microbial biomass and soil organic matter (SOM) showed strong correlation (R 2 value of 0.68-0.56) in two out of the three growing seasons. Calcium, magnesium, and potassium concentrations in soil also positively correlated with microbial biomass. There were significant differences among soils in numbers of plant parasitic, bacterial, and fungal feeding nematodes during the initial years of the study but the differences were not evident later. Shannon-Wiener diversity index was significantly affected by cover crop treatment with rye treatments generally exhibiting higher degree of soil microbial functional diversity. Biolog-EcoPlate??? assay was sensitive to changes in the short-term. Principal component analysis of the Biolog data allowed differentiation of treatments but distribution patterns varied from year to year. We conclude that both rye and rye-vetch mixture can affect the functional diversity of soil microbial community but differences between them are marginal when compared to compost and no-compost treatments. Microbial communities were more responsive to compost applications than cover crop effects. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Rewetting events after a drought produce a pulse of soil respiration (the " Birch Effect" ) that leads to a loss of carbon from soil, especially in Mediterranean ecosystems. Two main hypotheses have developed to explain the Birch effect: the " metabolic explanation" , based on the rapid consumption of intracellular osmolytes previously accumulated to survive to dry conditions, and the " physical explanation" , based on the consumption of carbon made accessible by physical destruction of internal structures of the soil.Here, we compared the respiration response of intact and crushed 9-4 mm aggregates from a California grassland soil under two different rewetting schemes: (1) successive short dry/wet events and (2) increased drought periods followed by a single rewetting. In intact aggregates, both microbial biomass and respiration rates were relatively stable through both experimental treatments. In crushed aggregates, through multiple short dry/wet cycles, both respiration rate and microbial biomass increased, while as drought length increased, biomass was unaffected but the magnitude of the following rewetting pulse increased. A mechanism that explains both these results is that crushing aggregates exposes occluded particular material that must be degraded into an immediately bioavailable form for microbes to take it up and metabolize it. Nitrification was generally higher in intact than crushed aggregates, suggesting the importance of physical association between nitrifiers and resources in regulating overall soil nitrification.This work suggests that physical processes are most important in driving respiration pulses through multiple rewetting cycles and that the physical association of organisms, substrates, and mineral particles are critical in controlling the functioning of the " microbial landscape". \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Advances in x-ray computed tomography (CT) provide powerful means to conduct such characterization. This study examined aggregate pore structure of three differently managed same textured Danish soils (mixed forage cropping, MFC; mixed cash cropping, MCC; cereal cash cropping, CCC) for (i) natural aggregates, and (ii) aggregates regenerated after 20 mo of incubation. In total, 27 aggregates (8-16 mm) were sampled from nine different treatments; three natural soils and three repacked lysimeters without and three with organic matter (OM; ground rape) amendment. Three dimensional x-ray CT images, tensile strength, and organic carbon (OC) were obtained for each aggregate. Aggregate-associated OC differed significantly between the three soils as 2.1, 1.4, and 1.0\% for MFC, MCC, and CCC, respectively. Aggregate porosity and pore connectivity were significantly higher for CCC aggregates than for MFC and MCC aggregates. The CCC aggregates had an average pore diameter of 300 mm, whereas MFC and MCC had an average pore diameter of 200 and 170 mm, respectively. Pore shape analysis indicated that CCC and MFC aggregates had an abundance of rounded and elongated pores, respectively, and those of MCC were in-between CCC and MFC. Aggregate pore structure development in the lysimeters was nearly similar irrespective of the soil type and organic matter amendment, and was vastly different from the state of natural aggregates. Aggregate porosity ({$>$}30 mm) was observed to be a good predictor for the mechanical properties of aggregates. In general natural aggregates were stronger than lysimeter aggregates.

We hypothesized that plant exudates could either gel or disperse soil depending on their chemical characteristics. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Optic) and maize (Zea mays L. cv. Freya) root exudates were collected using an aerated hydroponic method and compared with chia (Salvia hispanica L.) seed exudate, a commonly used root exudate analogue. Sandy loam soil was passed through a 500-{$\mu$}m mesh and treated with each exudate at a concentration of 4.6 mg exudate g -1 dry soil. Two sets of soil samples were prepared. One set of treated soil samples was maintained at 4\textdegree C to suppress microbial processes. To characterize the effect of decomposition, the second set of samples was incubated at 16\textdegree C for 2 weeks at -30 kPa matric potential. Gas chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry (GC\textendash MS) analysis of the exudates showed that barley had the largest organic acid content and chia the largest content of sugars (polysaccharide-derived or free), and maize was in between barley and chia. Yield stress of amended soil samples was measured by an oscillatory strain sweep test with a cone plate rheometer. When microbial decomposition was suppressed at 4\textdegree C, yield stress increased 20-fold for chia seed exudate and twofold for maize root exudate compared with the control, whereas for barley root exudate decreased to half. The yield stress after 2 weeks of incubation compared with soil with suppressed microbial decomposition increased by 85\% for barley root exudate, but for chia and maize it decreased by 87 and 54\%, respectively. Barley root exudation might therefore disperse soil and this could facilitate nutrient release. The maize root and chia seed exudates gelled soil, which could create a more stable soil structure around roots or seeds. Highlights: Rheological measurements quantified physical behaviour of plant exudates and effect on soil stabilization. Barley root exudates dispersed soil, which could release nutrients and carbon. Maize root and chia seed exudates had a stabilizing effect on soil. Physical engineering of soil in contact with plant roots depends on the nature and origin of exudates.},

  abstract = {One of the challenges in organic farming systems is to match nitrogen (N) mineralization from organic fertilizers and crop demand for N. The mineralization rate of organic N is mainly determined by the chemical composition of the organic matter being decomposed and the activity of the soil microflora. It has been shown that long-term organic fertilization can affect soil microbial biomass (MB), the microbial community structure, and the activity of enzymes involved in the decomposition of organic matter, but whether this has an impact on shortterm N mineralization from recently applied organic substances is not yet clear. Here, we sampled soils from a long-term field experiment, which had either not been fertilized, or fertilized with 30 or 60 t ha-1 year-1 of farmyard manure (FYM) since 1989. These soil samples were used in a 10-week pot experiment with or without addition of FYM before starting (recent fertilization). At the start and end of this experiment, soil MB, microbial basal respiration, total plant N, and mineral soil N content were measured, and a simplified N balance was calculated. Although the different treatments used in the long-term experiment induced significant differences in soil MB, as well as total soil C and N contents, the total N mineralization from FYM was not significantly affected by soil fertilization history. The amount of N released from FYM and not immobilized by soil microflora was about twice as high in the soil that had been fertilized with 60 t ha-1 year-1 of FYM as compared with the non-fertilized soil (p{$<$}0.05).},

We examined the utility of ecological and functional stoichiometry theories to explain microbial transformation of organic amendments in the soil and examined the key relationships between soil microbial community composition, biomass and activity with resource elemental composition (soil and organic input) and nutrient availability. Using two contrasting soils amended with raw green waste, its compost or biochar, we found that microbial PLFA composition was distinct for each soil and organic amendment. Microbial activity was strongly influenced by organic amendment. Further, we observed that changes in the soil stoichiometry with inputs were accompanied by changes in total PLFA and bacteria: fungal ratio, but the relationships between them were inconsistent and changed over time. Microbial activities involved in C, N and P cycling were generally correlated, but the relationship between hydrolase {$\beta$}-glucosidase (BGL) and microbial N and P activities was stronger and more consistent than that between oxidases (phenol oxidase PPO, peroxidase POX) and microbial N and P activities. These microbial activity relationships translated to a consistent relationship between log(BGL):log(nutrient) and soil C:nutrient but a weaker and inconsistent relationship between log(PPO+POX):log(nutrient) and soil C:nutrient. Our analyses indicate that microbial composition can be different, but stoichiometric invariance of microbial activity constrained microbial community response to organic input. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The release of organic compounds into the soil by plant roots increases the availability of carbon in the rhizosphere and consequently stimulates the growth and the activities of microorganisms. Therefore, the determination of carbon availability in soils is a key point to better understand nutrient flows. We investigated the short-term utilisation of C-14-[U]glucose by soil microorganisms to determine whether it could evidence differences in carbon availability between unplanted and maize-planted soils. In unplanted soils, the kinetics of glucose uptake indicated a multicomponent carrier-mediated transport. The lower affinity constant (K-m) for glucose uptake was determined at 74 muM of glucose. The kinetics of (CO2)-C-14 production from unplanted soil amended with 0.07 mug C-glucose g(-1) soil demonstrated a peak of respiratory activity during the first 15 min. One hour after C-14-glucose addition, the mineralisation of the substrate represented 7.8\% of the C-14 that was unrecovered by 0.5 M K2SO4 extraction and which was assumed to be absorbed by soil microorganisms (97\% of the C-14 amended). Three days after 14C-glucose addition, (CO2)-C-14 increased to 28\% of the absorbed glucose in unplanted soils. The C-14 extractable by K2SO4 after fumigation with chloroform remained constant with time (about 25\%). The apparent high efficiency of utilisation of C-14 suggested that under conditions of carbon limitation, the substrate is rather stored by microorganisms than used for growth. We proposed a model derived from the one of Bremer and Kuikman (Soil Biol. Biochem 26 (1994) 511) for the short-term uptake and utilisation of glucose by soil microorganisms. Furthermore, we found that the utilisation of C-14-glucose by microorganisms was significantly different between unplanted and maize-planted soils. In planted soils, microorganisms mineralised a significant larger proportion of the absorbed glucose (32\%) and the C-14-activity in the fraction released after fumigation by chloroform vapours was lower (22\%). This indicated a greater availability of carbon in maize-planted soils, which was related to the release of organic compounds by roots. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

After organic amendment, soil particle aggregation can increase due to the increase of organic matter, plant roots and microbially derived compounds. However, the effect of organic amendment addition over time on aggregate formation is not clear. The aim of this work was to study soil particle aggregation of a semiarid, degraded soil 5 years after the addition of a sole dose (120 Mg ha -1) of non-composted (SS) and composted sewage sludge (cSS). For this purpose, soils were separated into four aggregate-size fractions (8000\textendash 2000, 2000\textendash 250, 250\textendash 53 and b 53 {$\mu$}m) by wet sieving. Macroaggregates were further separated into coarse particulate organic matter (N250 {$\mu$}m), microaggregrates within macroaggregates (250\textendash 53 {$\mu$}m) and silt and clay (b 53 {$\mu$}m). In addition, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) of the treated soils were measured. After 5 years, the amended soils had a higher plant cover and greater amounts of large macroaggregates and microaggregates within macroaggregates than the control soil. Soil organic carbon (OC) was preferentially protected in the microaggregates within macroaggregates of the SS-treated soils, which tended to have higher fungal biomass than the rest of treatments. In contrast, the cSS-treated soils tended to have a lower microbial biomass than the SS-treated soils and showed the greatest relative enrichment of OC in the coarse particulate organic matter occluded in the macroaggregates. These results indicate that, depending on the pretreatment of the sewage sludge, the protection of OC over time occurs in different soil aggregate-size fractions, promoting a higher aggregate-associated OC in the composted amendments as coarse particulate organic matter.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity and carbon (C) cycling have been the focus of much research in recent decades, partly because both change as a result of anthropogenic activities that are likely to continue. Soils are extremely species-rich and store approximately 80\% of global terrestrial C. Soil organisms play a key role in C dynamics and a loss of species through global changes could influence global C dynamics. Here, we synthesize findings from published studies that have manipulated soil species richness and measured the response in terms of ecosystem functions related to C cycling (such as decomposition, respiration and the abundance or biomass of decomposer biota) to evaluate the impact of biodiversity loss on C dynamics. We grouped studies where one or more biotic groups had been manipulated to include a richness of {$<$} 10 species or {$>$} 10 species in order to reflect 'low' and 'high' extents of diversity manipulations. There was a positive relationship between species richness and C cycling in 77-100\% of low-diversity experiments, even when the richness of just one biotic group was manipulated, whereas positive relationships occurred less frequently in studies with greater richness (35-64\%). Moreover, when positive relationships were observed, these often indicated functional redundancy at low extents of diversity or that community composition had a stronger influence on C cycling than did species richness. Initial reductions in soil species richness resulting from global changes are unlikely to alter C dynamics significantly unless particularly influential species are lost. However, changes in community composition, and the loss of species with an ability to facilitate specialized soil processes related to C cycling, as a result of global changes, may have larger impacts on C dynamics.},

The present study uses a large set of fungal DNA sequences from the inclusive International Nucleotide Sequence Database to show that the taxon sampling of fungi is far from complete, that about 20\% of the entries may be incorrectly identified to species level, and that the majority of entries lack descriptive and up-to-date annotations. Conclusions. The problems with taxonomic reliability and insufficient annotations in public DNA repositories form a tangible obstacle to sequence-based species identification, and it is manifest that the greatest challenges to biological barcoding will be of taxonomical, rather than technical, nature. \textcopyright{} 2006 Nilsson et al.},

Asian J Agric 2: 25-37. To inquire the way the alteration of soils of various textures and fertility values with fertilizer-N and organic resources influencing aggregate formation and subsequent carbon (C) cycling in aggregates became the objective of this research. The experiment was carried out in Embu and Machang'a regions of central Kenya and was rooted on a putrefaction tube experiment that was established in April 2005. This experiment was intended at completing long-term field experimentations initiated in 2002 to set up the impact of the application of various combinations of organic and mineral resources on soil nutrient status. The main variables were fertilizer-N and organic resources, with the sub-management being soil fertility values. Maize stover and urea fertilizer were mixed with 3.2 kg of soil and put in putrefaction tubes. The implementation rate was 4 ton and 120 kg per hectare for the maize stover and fertilizer respectively. Four management were developed, namely: control (no organic resources or fertilizer-N added), lone fertilizer-N, lone stover, and combined stover and fertilizer-N, with each management having three replicates. To decide the alterations in soil aggregates, dirt samples acquired from the putrefaction tubes were fractionated through wet sieving. SOM fractionation was also carried out to gain the various SOM fractions. All achieved aggregates and SOM fractions were then dried in the oven, ground, and analyzed for C. All collected data were examined with the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS and the means separated at p {$<$}0.05. Bigger quantity of macroaggregates from Embu soils was studied than that from Machang'a soils. For both Embu and Machang'a soil, the alteration of soils with lone or combined fertilizer-N and organic resources had a notable impact (p {$<$}0.05) on the portions of all aggregate class sizes. The alteration of soils of various fertility values with lone or combined fertilizer-N and organic resources also had a notable impact on the allocation of SOM fractions for both Embu and Machang' soils. Remarkable discrepancies in whole soils, aggregates and SOM fractions percentage carbon values were also studied. On the whole, the silt and clay fraction had higher C values than that in other aggregate size classes representing higher stabilization of C within this fraction. From the results of this research, it is concluded that the utilization of combined organic and mineral resources is preferred for the enhancement and the preservation of soil fertility in high fertility soils. In low fertility coarse-textured soils, the lone implementation of organic resources is suggested for the enhancement and the preservation of soil fertility.},

Although a number of studies have indicated that microbial communities are not intrinsically functionally similar, most soil C dynamics models can adequately describe C dynamics without explicitly describing microbial functioning. Here, we provide a mechanistic basis for reconciling this apparent discrepancy. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, we show that the environmental context (soil and pore-network properties) of microbial communities can constrain the activity of functionally different communities to such an extent that their activities are indistinguishable. The data also suggest that when microbial activity is less constrained, the intrinsic functional differences among communities can be expressed. We conclude that soil C dynamics may depend on microbial community structure or diversity in environments where their activity is less constrained, such as the rhizosphere or the litter layer, but not in oligotrophic environments such as the mineral layers of soil.},

Restoration of native ecosystems can help degraded soils rebuild a portion of the depleted soil organic matter. However, the rate and magnitude of soil carbon accrual can be highly variable from site to site. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling soil organic carbon stocks is necessary to improve predictions of soil carbon recovery. We measured soil organic carbon stocks and a suite of edaphic factors in the upper 10cm of a series of restored tallgrass prairies representing a range of drainage conditions. Our findings suggest that factors related to soil organic matter stabilization mechanisms (texture, polyvalent cations) were key predictors of soil organic carbon, along with variables that influence plant and microbial biomass (available phosphorus, pH) and soil moisture. Exchangeable soil calcium was the strongest single predictor, explaining 74\% of the variation in soil organic carbon, followed by clay content, which explained 52\% of the variation. Our results demonstrate that the cumulative effects of even relatively small differences in these edaphic properties can have a large impact on soil carbon stocks when integrated over several decades.},

These measurements of carbon (C) turnover are frequently made in the laboratory where it is easier to control the experimental conditions. However, this could potentially bias the results due to a range of factors including the absence of plants and associated mycorrhizas, physical disturbance, alteration in redox status etc. The aim of this study was therefore to directly compare the turnover of organic acids under field and laboratory conditions in three contrasting land use regimes (grassland, woodland and arable). The method involved the injection of 14C-labeled citric acid into the top soil and monitoring of its mineralization by capturing 14CO2 evolved from the soil over a 7 day period. Laboratory climate conditions were matched to those in the field. In both the laboratory and the field we showed that 14CO2 evolution followed a bi-phasic pattern and conformed extremely well to a double first-order kinetic model. While the first rapid mineralization phase showed a similar half-life for citrate under both laboratory and field conditions (4.9 \AE{} 0.7 h), the second slower mineralization phase had a significantly longer half-life when performed in the field. Overall, our results suggest that the first rapid mineralization phase was largely independent of our experimental conditions whilst the turnover of the citratederived C immobilized in the microbial biomass was significantly affected by the incubation conditions either due to differences in substrate utilization and storage pathways or due to faster microbial turnover in the laboratory.},

Our objective here is to determine whether a general relationship exists between biodiversity and standing biomass. We used hierarchical mixed eff ects models, based on a power function between species richness and biomass production (Y ϭ a ϫ S b), and a database of 374 published experiments to estimate the BEF relationship (the change in biomass with the addition of species), and its associated uncertainty, in the context of environmental factors. We found that the mean relationship (b ϭ 0.26, 95\% CI: 0.16, 0.37) characterized the vast majority of observations, was robust to diff erences in experimental design, and was independent of the range of species richness levels considered. However, the richness \textendash{} biomass relationship varied by trophic level and among ecosystems; in aquatic systems b was nearly twice as large for consumers (herbivores and detritivores) compared to primary producers; in terrestrial ecosystems, b for detritivores was negative but depended on few studies. We estimated changes in biomass expected for a range of changes in species richness, highlighting that species loss has greater implications than species gains, skewing a distribution of biomass change relative to observed species richness change. When biomass provides a good proxy for processes that underpin ecosystem services, this relationship could be used as a step in modeling the production of ecosystem services and their dependence on biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Archaea constitute a considerable fraction of the microbial biomass on Earth. Like Bacteria they have evolved a variety of energy metabolisms using organic and/or inorganic electron donors and acceptors, and many of them are able to fix carbon from inorganic sources. Archaea thus play crucial roles in the Earth's global geochemical cycles and influence greenhouse gas emissions. Methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation are important steps in the carbon cycle; both are performed exclusively by anaerobic archaea. Oxidation of ammonia to nitrite is performed by Thaumarchaeota. They represent the only archaeal group that resides in large numbers in the global aerobic terrestrial and marine environments on Earth. Sulfur-dependent archaea are confined mostly to hot environments, but metal leaching by acidophiles and reduction of sulfate by anaerobic, nonthermophilic methane oxidizers have a potential impact on the environment. The metabolisms of a large number of archaea, in particular those dominating the subsurface, remain to be explored.},

We derived estimates of management impacts for a carbon accounting approach developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, addressing the impact of long-term cultivation, setting-aside land from crop production, changing tillage management, and modifying C input to the soil by varying cropping practices. We found 126 articles that met our criteria and analyzed the data in linear mixed-effect models. In general, management impacts were sensitive to climate in the following order from largest to smallest changes in SOC: tropical moist{$>$}tropical dry{$>$}temperate moist{$>$}temperate dry. For example, long-term cultivation caused the greatest loss of SOC in tropical moist climates, with cultivated soils having 0.58 \AE{} 0.12, or 58\% of the amount found under native vegetation, followed by tropical dry climates with 0.69 \AE{} 0.13, temperate moist with 0.71 \AE{} 0.04, and temperate dry with 0.82 \AE{} 0.04. Similarly, converting from conventional tillage to no-till increased SOC storage over 20 years by a factor of 1.23 \AE{} 0.05 in tropical moist climates, which is a 23\% increase in SOC, while the corresponding change in tropical dry climates was 1.17 \AE{} 0.05, temperate moist was 1.16 \AE{} 0.02, and temperate dry was 1.10 \AE{} 0.03. These results demonstrate that agricultural management impacts on SOC storage will vary depending on climatic conditions that influence the plant and soil processes driving soil organic matter dynamics.},

We sampled microbial communities in soil from nonvegetated areas and under the canopies of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants from 20- to 80-year-old zones along the successional gradient, Three independent measures of microbial biomass were used: substrate-induced respiration (SIR), phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, and direct microscopic counts. All methods indicated that biomass increased over successional time in the nonvegetated soil. PLFA analysis indicated that the microbial biomass was greater under the plant canopies than in the nonvegetated soils; the microbial community composition was clearly different between these two types of soils. Over the successional gradient, the microbial community shifted from bacterial-dominated to fungal-dominated. Microbial respiration increased while specific activity (respiration per unit biomass) decreased in nonvegetated soils over the successional gradient. We proposed and evaluated new parameters for estimating the C use efficiency of the soil microbial community: "Max" indicates the maximal respiration rate and "Acc" the total C released from the sample after a standard amount of substrate is added. These, as well as the corresponding specific activities (calculated as Max and Acc per unit biomass), decreased sharply over the successional gradient. Our study suggests that during the early stages of succession the microbial community cannot incorporate all the added substrate into its biomass, but rapidly increases its respiration. The later-stage microbial community cannot reach as high a rate of respiration per unit biomass but remains in an "energy-saving state," accumulating C to its biomass.},

Thus, our objective was to evaluate tillage-induced influences on aggregate structure, residue-derived C stabilization, and the subsequent efficiency of C stabilization in aggregates of no-till (NT) and tillage management (TM) practices at different depth increments of the soil profile. Uniformly C-13-labeled wheat residues were added to incubation cores representing soils under NT and TM during a year-long in situ incubation at a dryland agriculture experiment site. Residue was added directly onto the surface of NT cores, while residues were incorporated into the 0- to 5-, 5- to 15, and 15- to 30-cm depth increments of the TM cores. We found that residue additions did not have a significant effect (P {$>$} 0.05) on aggregate dynamics in either NT or TM, but NT management did result in the greatest stabilization of residue-derived C (11.2 +/- 2.4 g residue C kg(-1) soil kg(-1) residue C added, P {$<$} 0.05) in the macroaggregate ({$>$}250-mu m) fraction of the 0- to 15-cm increment. Residue-derived C stabilization was significantly greater (P {$<$} 0.05) in the 0- to 30-cm increment than in the 0- to 15-cm increment of the TM management cores. Overall, our results indicate that, within a plow depth of 15 cm, limiting the tillage-induced disruption of aggregates has a stronger influence on the efficiency of C stabilization than residue incorporation into the profile via tillage. When residues are distributed to a 30-cm depth, however, the negative impact of aggregate disruption through tillage appears counterbalanced, with similar efficiencies of C stabilization between the NT and TM practices, possibly due to slower decomposition of residues deeper in the profile.},

The review focuses on the following aspects of ligninolytic fungi: the taxonomic and functional diversity of ligninolytic fungi, the outcomes of interactions between ligninolytic fungi and other organisms, the activity and abundance of ligninolytic fungi measured by the production of bleached leaves and humus, the activity of ligninolytic enzymes in soil environments, the substratum and seral succession, spatial and temporal patterns in both mycelial abundance and species distribution, and the effect of environmental factors such as nitrogen deposition and global environmental changes on ligninolytic fungi. This review integrates the ecology, diversity, and activity of ligninolytic fungi into the context of an ecosystem in order to provide an understanding of the roles of ligninolytic fungi in decomposition processes.},

  abstract = {Tropical ecosystems are under increasing pressure of land-use changes, strongly affecting the carbon cycle. Conversion from natural to agri-cultural ecosystems is often accompanied by a decrease in the stocks of organic and microbial carbon (Corg, Cmic) as well as changes in microbial activity and litter decomposition. Eleven ecosystems along an elevation gradient on the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro were used to investigate impacts of land-use changes on Corg and Cmic stocks as well as the specific metabolic respiration quotient (qsCO2) in surface soils. Six natural, two semi-natural and three intensively used agricultural ecosystems were investigated on an elevation gradient from 950 to 3,880\,m\,asl. To estimate the effects of precipitation, rainfall regimes of 3{$\cdot$}6 and 20{$\cdot$}0\,mm were simulated. Corg stocks were controlled by water availability, temperature and net primary production. Agricultural management resulted in decreases of Corg and Cmic stocks by 38\% and 76\%, respectively. In addition, agricultural systems were characterized by low Cmic:Corg ratios, indicating a decline in available substrate. Enhanced land-use intensity leads to increased qsCO2 (agricultural\,{$>$}\,semi-natural\,{$>$}\,natural). The traditional homegardens stood out as a sustainable land-use form with high substrate availability and microbial efficiency. Soil CO2 efflux and qsCO2 generally increased with precipitation level. We conclude that soils of Mt. Kilimanjaro's ecosystems are highly sensitive to land-use changes and are vulnerable to changes in precipitation, especially at low elevations. Even though qsCO2 was measured under different water contents, it can be used as an indicator of ecosystem disturbances caused by land-use and management practices.

Application of 100\% NPK (120 kg N ? 60 kg P2O5 and 40 kg K2O) ? FYM @ 10 t ha-1 produced the highest grain yield of rice of 5.2 t ha-1 and wheat of 4.7 t ha-1. Conjoint use of 100\% NPK and FYM increased the organic carbon content by 7.4 and 10.1\% in soil after rice and wheat harvest, respectively, over initial level of 1.48\%, and it decreased by 39.2\textendash 44.6\% and 36.8\textendash 49.1\% in other NPK fertilizers treatments. In the control treatment, organic C was reduced it to about one-third of the value recorded at initiation of the experiment. In the absence of P, K, S, and Zn addition, continuous cropping drastically reduced their availability in soil over the years. However, no perceptible change in pH was observed. Physical properties were improved with integrated use of fertilizers and manure. Total organic carbon and its different active and passive pools C fractions in soil were influenced significantly with fertilizer management practices and were positively correlated with yields and most of the soil properties. Among soil properties, available K and hydraulic conductivity were found to be more closely correlated with soil C fractions.},

The addition of organic materials to the soil increased the values of biomass carbon, basal respiration, biomass C/total organic C ratio and metabolic quotient (qCO2), indicating the activation of soil microorganisms. These biological parameters showed a decreasing tendency with time. Nevertheless, their values in amended soils were higher than in control soil, which clearly indicates the improvement of soil biological quality brought about by the organic amendment. This favorable effect on soil biological activity was more noticeable with the addition of fresh wastes (municipal solid waste or sewage sludge) than with compost. In turn, this effect was more permanent when the soil was amended with municipal solid waste than when it was amended with sewage sludge.},

Mineralization of native soil organic matter is not regulated by the size, activity or composition of the soil microbial biomass \textendash{} a new perspective. Soil Biology and Biochemistry 40, 61\textendash 73] proposing the existence of an abiotic regulatory gate that controls the ratelimiting step of stabilised soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization, has initiated a fundamental and farreaching debate. In this contribution the implications of a functioning abiotic regulatory gate are considered in the context of microbial community diversity and soil carbon cycling. I argue that although the evidence presented in support of the regulatory gate is strong, abiotic routes for SOM-mineralization function in parallel with biologically mediated mechanisms. Evidence is now accumulating that, in the presence of plant-inputs to soil, enhanced microbial mobilisation of SOM into biomass is a quantitatively important and ubiquitous process. I argue that this mineralization of SOM is fuelled by energy-rich substrates and is driven by microbial nutrient-demand. This implies that the mineralization of stabilised SOM and the turnover of C-inputs from current vegetation are intimately linked through the functioning of microbial communities associated with plants. This suggests that the microbial `eye of the needle' is a crucial control-point in determining the carbon balance of soils. Fortunately, there are now excellent methods that allow quantification of SOM- and plant-derived C-fluxes through the members of soil microbial communities, and will also allow quantification of the relative importance of the abiotic and biotic routes of SOM-mineralization.},

Information on turnover of organic matter components, the role of microbial products, and modeling of SOM, and tracer research should help us to anticipate what future research may answer today's challenges. Our globe's most important natural resource is best studied relative to its chemistry, dynamics, matrix interactions, and microbial transformations. Humus has similar, worldwide characteristics, but varies with abiotic controls, soil type, vegetation inputs and composition, and the soil biota. It contains carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, phenol-aromatics, protein-derived and cyclic nitrogenous compounds, and some still unknown compounds. Protection of transformed plant residues and microbial products occurs through spatial inaccessibility-resource availability, aggregation of mineral and organic constituents, and interactions with sesquioxides, cations, silts, and clays. Tracers that became available in the mid-20th century made the study of SOM dynamics possible. Carbon dating identified resistant, often mineral-associated, materials to be thousands of years old, especially at depth in the profile. The13C associated with C3C4plant switches characterized slow turnover pools with ages ranging from dozens to hundreds of years. Added tracers, in conjunction with compound-specific product analysis and incubation, identified active pools with fast turnover rates. Physical fractionations of the intra- and inter-aggregate materials, and those associated with silt and clay, showed that all pools contain both old and young materials. Charcoal is old but not inert. The C:N ratio changes from 25 to 70:1 for plant residues to 6 to 9:1 for soil biota and microbial products associated with soil minerals. Active, slow and passive (resistant) pool concepts have been well used in biogeochemical models. The concepts discussed herein have implications for today's challenges in nutrient cycling, biogeochemistry, soil ecosystem functioning, pollution control, feeding the expanding global population and global change.},

By existing approaches the amount of rhizodeposition can only roughly be estimated since its persistence in soil is very short compared to other organic C pools. We suggest an approach to quantify rhizodeposition at the field scale by assuming a constant ratio between rhizodeposited-C to root-C.MethodsMaize plants were pulse-labeled with 14CO2 under controlled conditions and the soil 14CO2 efflux was separated into root and rhizomicrobial respiration. The latter and the 14C activity remaining in the soil corresponded to total rhizodeposition. By relating rhizodeposited-14C to root-14C a rhizodeposition-to-root ratio of 0.56 was calculated. This ratio was applied to the root biomass C measured in the field to estimate rhizodeposition under field conditions.ResultsMaize allocated 298 kg C ha-1 as root-C and 166 kg C ha-1 as rhizodeposited-C belowground, 50 \% of which were recovered in the upper 10 cm. The fate of rhizodeposits was estimated based on the 14C data, which showed that 62 \% of total rhizodeposition was mineralized within 16 days, 7 \% and 0.3 \% was incorporated into microbial biomass and DOC, respectively, and 31 \% was recovered in the soil.ConclusionsWe conclude that the present approach allows for an improved estimation of total rhizodeposition, since it accounts not only for the fraction of rhizodeposits remaining in soil, but also for that decomposed by microorganisms and released from the soil as CO2.},

  abstract = {Despite its fundamental role for carbon (C) and nutrient cycling, rhizodeposition remains `the hidden half of the hidden half': it is highly dynamic and rhizodeposits are rapidly incorporated into microorganisms, soil organic matter, and decomposed to CO2. Therefore, rhizodeposition is rarely quantified and remains the most uncertain part of the soil C cycle and of C fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems. This review synthesizes and generalizes the literature on C inputs by rhizodeposition under crops and grasslands (281 data sets). The allocation dynamics of assimilated C (after 13C-CO2 or 14C-CO2 labeling of plants) were quantified within shoots, shoot respiration, roots, net rhizodeposition (i.e., C remaining in soil for longer periods), root-derived CO2, and microorganisms. Partitioning of C pools and fluxes were used to extrapolate belowground C inputs via rhizodeposition to ecosystem level. Allocation from shoots to roots reaches a maximum within the first day after C assimilation. Annual crops retained more C (45\% of assimilated 13C or 14C) in shoots than grasses (34\%), mainly perennials, and allocated 1.5 times less C belowground. For crops, belowground C allocation was maximal during the first 1\textendash 2 months of growth and decreased very fast thereafter. For grasses, it peaked after 2\textendash 4 months and remained very high within the second year causing much longer allocation periods. Despite higher belowground C allocation by grasses (33\%) than crops (21\%), its distribution between various belowground pools remains very similar. Hence, the total C allocated belowground depends on the plant species, but its further fate is species independent. This review demonstrates that C partitioning can be used in various approaches, e.g., root sampling, CO2 flux measurements, to assess rhizodeposits' pools and fluxes at pot, plot, field and ecosystem scale and so, to close the most uncertain gap of the terrestrial C cycle.},

  abstract = {Land-use change (LUC) from natural to human-dominated land is a critical aspect of global change and ecosystem response. To improve our understanding of LUC, this study focused on: (1) developing a general theoretical framework for quantifying and evaluating the attributes of ecosystem response as a consequence of LUC; and (2) testing the validity of this framework using recent LUC in the desert fringe of the northern Negev Desert. Our framework is based on the premise that changes in soil and vegetation states are the most important and universal facets of ecosystems' response to LUC. The framework depicts LUC as trajectories of indicators that signify soil and vegetation states, such as the soil quality index (SQI) and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), respectively, in a phase plane. The trajectories are characterized by both magnitude and the direction of the change that enable us to address and compare the general trends of the LUC. Our study explored the validity of the proposed framework for the following LUC cases: (1) grazing to natural ecosystem; (2) natural to grazing ecosystem; (3) rain-fed agricultural to natural ecosystem; and (4) rain-fed agricultural to grazing ecosystem. The SQI was quantified by 14 physical, biological, and chemical attributes that were merged into one index, while the ANPP was derived from biomass sampling. All transitions show strong relationships between SQI and ANPP (0.70 {$<$} R2 {$<$} 0.85; p {$<$} 0.05). Transitions from grazing to natural ecosystems are characterized by an increase in both SQI and ANPP variables; while all transitions that change from agricultural systems to less intensively managed systems, such as grazing or a natural system, show no change or a decrease in both SQI and ANPP. We infer that all the trajectories' trends are a result of changes in the biodiversity dimensions during LUC. Analysis of the results revealed four properties of a theoretical framework that can be used for the developing science of LUC and ecosystem responses. Our framework enables: (1) a comparison between different types of LUC; (2) a study of transitions among self-organized and managed ecosystems; (3) the identification of short- and long-term effects; and (4) the integration of biodiversity and ecosystem function. We suggest that the four properties of the framework can provide the foundation for the development of an LUC science. However, the validity and the generality of the framework should be tested over a wide range of LUCs of terrestrial systems in the world.},

In this study, we raise the question whether soil functioning can be captured in a concept denominated normal operating range (NOR), or the normal fluctuations in soil functioning under field conditions. We further examine how this concept could be effectively used to evaluate the impact of disturbances on agricultural ecosystems. We propose the establishment of a NOR on the basis of multiple parameters in the soil. These should include so-called sensitive processes, that is, those processes that are poorly redundant and easily deviate following a stress situation. The model that we built allowed to visualize the interplay of multiple soil parameters, under which the sensitive ones, which would be most indicative of a disturbance. Here we use the initial step of nitrification, i.e. ammonia oxidation, as an example of a sensitive process. By capturing the normal fluctuations in ammonia oxidation-related parameters that take into account population dynamics, and implementing these in a mathematical model, a multidimensional representation of the NOR of soil function is created which is useful in tests of resilience in the context of disturbances. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, few direct observations of aggregate dynamics are reported in the literature. A 2-yr field study was performed to observe active organic C dynamics and soil macroaggregate dynamics in two contrasting soils. Dysprosium-labelled tracer spheres were applied to field plots to observe soil macroaggregate dynamics, while CO2-evolution during 10-d laboratory incubations was used to measure active C dynamics. Results of biochemical analyses showed higher active C turnover in the low C soil, suggesting a lower proportion of incoming organic matter was protected when compared with the high C soil. No net aggregation or degradation was determined over the long-term, suggesting the soil was at steady-state. However, aggregation followed a cyclical pattern reset by the over-winter period and tillage. Tracer incorporation into large macroaggregates was observed within 9 d after tillage, reaching a maximum of 40 to 60\% tracer incorporation into {$>$}1-mm aggregates after 72 d. A rapid approach to equilibrium within the study period reflected rapid dynamics of macroaggregates in both soils studied. Slower macroaggregate dynamics in the high C soil were attributed to sustained aggregate stability and resiliency at the end of the growing season. Based on observations of macroaggregate dynamics in soils with contrasting active organic C dynamics, we suggest that rapid macroaggregate turnover not only results in the exposure of labile organic matter but also provides a mechanism for the occlusion and physical protection of particulate organic matter.},

  abstract = {The objective of this work was to describe a method for isolating meaningful and measurable soil organic matter (SOM) pools that differ in the mechanisms by which they are protected from decomposition. The proposed method is appropriate for soil C stabilization and sequestration studies. Unlike previous fractionation schemes, this procedure allows free SOM located between aggregates (unprotected C pool) and SOM occluded within both macroaggregates and microaggregates (C weakly and strongly protected by physical mechanisms, respectively) to be recovered separately, freed from the soil mineral matrix and the mineral-associated SOM pool (C pool protected by chemical mechanisms) and thus well suited to advanced chemical characterization by 13C-NMR. Briefly, free SOM is isolated by an initial density separation. Stable macroaggregates are broken up into stable microaggregates and intra-macroaggregate SOM, which is then separated by density. Finally, intra-microaggregate SOM is isolated from mineral-associated SOM by a third density separation after ultrasonic disruption. The SOM dissolved during the fractionation procedure is also recovered. Results obtained on soil samples with contrasting textures suggested that clay content induces a decrease of the proportion of free organic C and an increase of mineral-associated organic C content. Free SOM is characterized by a marked presence of undecayed organic material and biologically labile substances, such as carbohydrates and proteins. In contrast, SOM occluded within aggregates, especially within microaggregates, represents a more decomposed fraction, relatively enriched in unsubstituted-aliphatic material, most probably lipid biopolymers.},

  abstract = {Conservation tillage practices that entail no or reduced soil disturbance are known to help preserve or accumulate soil organic matter (OM). However, the underlying mechanisms especially at the molecular level are not well understood. In this study soil samples from 25-year-old experimental plots continuously cropped with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) under no-tillage (NT) and chisel tillage (CT) were subjected to a new physical fractionation method to isolate dissolved OM, mineral-free particulate OM located outside aggregates (physically and chemically unprotected), OM occluded within both macroaggregates and microaggregates (weakly and strongly protected by physical mechanisms, respectively), and OM in intimate association with minerals (protected by chemical mechanisms). The whole soils and OM fractions were analyzed for organic C and N content and by modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The soil under NT stored 16\% more organic C and 5\% more N than the soil under CT. Compared to CT, NT increased free organic C content by 7\%, intra-macroaggregate organic C content by 20\%, intra-microaggregate organic C content by 63\%, and mineral-associated organic C content by 16\% and decreased dissolved organic C content by 11\%. The mineral-associated OM pool accounted for 65\% of the difference in total organic C content between NT and CT, whereas the intra-microaggregate OM only explained 18\%, intra-macroaggregate OM 14\%, and free OM 11\%. The NMR experiments revealed that the free and intra-aggregate OM fractions were dominated by crop-derived materials at different stages of decomposition, whereas the mineral-associated OM pool was predominately of microbial origin. Overall, our results indicate that microbes and microbial by-products associated with mineral surfaces and likely physically protected by entrapment within very small microaggregates constitute the most important pool of OM stabilization and C sequestration in soils under NT. Most probably the slower macroaggregate turnover in NT relative to CT boosts not only the formation of microaggregates and thereby the physical protection of crop-derived particulate OM, but more importantly the interaction between mineral particles and microbial material that results in the formation of very stable organo-mineral complexes. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Interactions between organic matter (OM), minerals and charcoal may play an important role in the development and stabilization of OM in soils. However, these interactions are difficult to characterize in natural soils, which are usually very complex systems with unknown initial conditions. We developed so-called 'artificial soils' with a texture and OM content similar to natural arable soils that were incubated up to 18 months. The aim was to determine the turnover and development of OM with incubation time, and to establish the effect of mineral composition and charcoal presence on organic carbon (OC) and N distribution and properties. Artificial soils were composed of quartz, manure as OM source and a microbial community extracted from a natural arable soil, with 8 different mixtures of montmorillonite, illite, ferrihydrite, boehmite and charcoal. We determined C and N particle size distribution with time and used solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and acid hydrolysis to determine the development of OM composition. The CO2 respiration rate and distribution of OC and N with particle size was similar for all artificial soil compositions. OC and N accumulated in the {$<$}20{$\mu$}m fraction over time and approximately 50\% of coarse ({$>$}200{$\mu$}m) particulate OM was lost after 18 months of incubation. 13C NMR spectroscopy indicated accumulation of protein-rich OC in the {$<$}20{$\mu$}m fraction, likely in the form of microbially produced substances. Acid hydrolysis showed a higher content of non-hydrolysable N in the mixtures containing clay minerals, indicating that some of the nitrogen present was strongly bound to phylosilicate surfaces. Ferrihydrite did not have any effect on non-hydrolysable N. From this, it can be concluded that in the artificial soils, clay minerals were more important than metal-oxides for the binding of nitrogen and OC. Overall, the artificial soils developed similarly to incubation experiments with natural soils, and were therefore a valuable model system where the effect of specific components on the development and turnover of soil OM could be determined under simplified conditions. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In addition, silt- and sand-sized quartz were used to provide texture, sterilised manure was added as OM source and the mixtures were inoculated with a microbial community extracted from a natural soil.

Amino sugar content was generally low and changed only slightly in the. {$<$} 20. ??m fraction with incubation time, which shows that microbial residues in the form of amino sugars did not preferentially accumulate with time. The montmorillonite-containing mixture had a higher galactosamine and glucosamine content than the others, pointing to greater fungal residue formation. The effect was most pronounced for the bulk soil, indicating that fungal residues accumulated on coarse particulate OM and macroaggregates rather than in the fine fraction. The results illustrate that amino sugars can be a biomarker for studying the effect of mineral composition on microbial residues and SOM formation. However, it is important to consider the entire soil structure in order to gain understanding of the interaction between microorganisms, minerals and SOM.},

  abstract = {Increase of belowground C allocation by plants under global warming or elevated CO2 may promote decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) by priming and strongly affects SOC dynamics. The specific effects by priming of SOC depend on the amount and frequency of C inputs. Most previous priming studies have investigated single C additions, but they are not very representative for litterfall and root exudation in many terrestrial ecosystems. We evaluated effects of (13)C-labeled glucose added to soil in three temporal patterns: single, repeated, and continuous on dynamics of CO2 and priming of SOC decomposition over 6 months. Total and (13)C labeled CO2 were monitored to analyze priming dynamics and net C balance between SOC loss caused by priming and the retention of added glucose-C. Cumulative priming ranged from 1.3 to 5.5 mg C g(-1) SOC in the subtropical, and from -0.6 to 5.5 mg C g(-1) SOC in the tropical soils. Single addition induced more priming than repeated and continuous inputs. Therefore, single additions of high substrate amounts may overestimate priming effects over the short term. The amount of added glucose C remaining in soil after 6 months (subtropical: 8.1-11.2 mg C g(-1) SOC or 41-56\% of added glucose; tropical: 8.7-15.0 mg C g(-1) SOC or 43-75\% of glucose) was substantially higher than the net C loss due to SOC decomposition including priming effect. This overcompensation of C losses was highest with continuous inputs and lowest with single inputs. Therefore, raised labile organic C input to soils by higher plant productivity will increase SOC content even though priming accelerates decomposition of native SOC. Consequently, higher continuous input of C belowground by plants under warming or elevated CO2 can increase C stocks in soil despite accelerated C cycling by priming in soils.},

  abstract = {Rhizodeposited carbon (C) is an important source of soil organic C, and plays an important role in the C cycle in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. However, interactive effects of plant species and soil nutrient availability on C rhizodeposition remain unclear. This experiment examined the effect of soil nutrient availability on C rhizodeposition of C4 maize and C3 soybean with contrasting photosynthetic capacity. The soils (Mollisols) were collected from three treatments of no fertilizer (Control), inorganic fertilizer only (NPK), and NPK plus organic manure (NPKM) in a 24-year fertilization field trial. The plants were labelled with 13C at the vegetative and reproductive stages. The 13C abundance of shoots, roots and soil were quantified at 0, 7 days after 13C labelling, and at maturity. Increasing soil nutrient availability enhanced the C rhizodeposition due to the greater C fixation in shoots and distribution to roots and soil. The higher amount of averaged below-ground C allocated to soil resulted in greater specific rhizodeposited C from soybean than maize. Additional organic amendment further enhanced them. As a result, higher soil nutrient availability increased total soil organic C under both maize and soybean systems though there was no significant difference between the two crop systems. All these suggested that higher soil nutrient availability favors C rhizodeposition. Mean 80, 260 and 300 kg fixed C ha-1 were estimated to transfer into soil in the Control, NPK and NPKM treatments, respectively, during one growing season. \textcopyright{} 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although phosphorus is considered the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton production in freshwater systems, the effects of atmospheric nitrogen and its contribution to acidification of fresh waters can be detrimental. Within the estuarine to coastal continuum, multiple nutrient limitations occur among nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon along the salinity gradient and by season, but nitrogen is generally considered the primary limiting nutrient for phytoplankton biomass accumulation. There are well-established, but nonlinear, positive relationships among nitrogen and phosphorus flux, phytoplankton primary production, and fisheries yield. There are thresholds, however, where the load of nutrients to estuarine, coastal and marine systems exceeds the capacity for assimilation of nutrient-enhanced production, and water-quality degradation occurs. Impacts can include noxious and toxic algal blooms, increased turbidity with a subsequent loss of submerged aquatic vegetation, oxygen deficiency, disruption of ecosystem functioning, loss of habitat, loss of biodiversity, shifts in food webs, and loss of harvestable fisheries.},

We hypothesized that (i) compared with macro-aggregates SOC mineralization rate of micro-aggregates would be slower, (ii) adsorption of SOC on {$<$}53{$\mu$}m fraction decreases the SOC mineralization rate, and (iii) land use has a significant influence on SOC decomposition rate. To test these hypotheses we collected topsoil from Dermosol (Acrisols in FAO Soil Classification) sites under three contrasting land uses namely native pasture (NP), crop-pasture rotation (CP) and woodland (WL). Macro-aggregates, micro-aggregates and the {$<$}53{$\mu$}m fraction were separated from bulk soil by wet sieving. The three aggregate size ranges were then incubated for six months and CO2 evolution was measured at different time intervals. The chemically stable SOC of {$<$}53{$\mu$}m fraction of macro-aggregates, micro-aggregates and the {$<$}53{$\mu$}m fraction (separated by wet sieving) was measured by oxidation of SOC with 10\% H2O2. On average, cumulative mineralization, Cmin (gCO2-Ckg-1 aggregate) of the {$<$}53{$\mu$}m fraction, was 28\% lower than that of macro-aggregates and micro-aggregates. However, SOC mineralized (SOCmin) was similar in all size fractions. The size of slow SOC pool (percent of SOC concentration in aggregates) was also significantly higher in the {$<$}53{$\mu$}m fraction and ranged from 58 to 96\%, across aggregate sizes. However, the chemically stable SOC (percent of SOC concentration in aggregates) was significantly higher in macro-aggregates and micro-aggregates than that of the {$<$}53{$\mu$}m fraction. Mean residence time (MRT) of slow SOC pool (MRTs) was higher in the {$<$}53{$\mu$}m fraction than for either macro-aggregates or micro-aggregates. Among the land uses NP had higher SOCmin compared with CP and WL. In conclusion, the insignificant difference in SOCmin, slow SOC pool sizes and MRTs between macro-aggregates and micro-aggregates indicated that SOC mineralization rate and thus the protection of SOC was similar in both macro-aggregates and micro-aggregates. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We focus on the biomass production, storage and filtering of water, storage and recycling of nutrients, carbon storage, habitat for biological activity, and physical stability and support. A selection of frequently used soil structural properties are analyzed and discussed from a methodological point of view and with respect to their relevance to soil functions. These are properties extracted from soil profile description, visual soil assessment, aggregate size and stability analysis, bulk density, mercury porosimetry, water retention curve, gas adsorption, and imaging techniques. We highlight the greater relevance of the pore network characterization as compared to the aggregate perspective. We identify porosity, macroporosity, pore distances, and pore connectivity derived from imaging techniques as being the most relevant indicators for several soil functions. Since imaging techniques are not widely accessible, we suggest using this technique to build up an open access ``soil structure library'' for a large range of soil types, which could form the basis to relate more easily available measures to pore structural attributes in a site-specific way (i.e., taking into account texture, soil organic matter content, etc.).},

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of land abandonment on N levels and dynamics in farmlands and abandoned lands in Central Iran. Total N (TN), net N mineralization and microbial biomass N of the 0e15 and 15e30 cm depths from lands abandoned for 18e22 years were compared to those from traditionally cultivated wheat-follow ({$>$}45 yr) and continuous alfalfa ({$>$}40 yr) fields. Soil TN contents (g kg\`A1) and pools (Mg ha\`A1) in the 0 e15 cm soil layer increased significantly in abandoned lands, with no effect in the 15e30 cm soil layer after land abandonment. Soil net N mineralization (Nmin) was higher in abandoned and alfalfa fields than in wheat fields, while relative N mineralization (Nmin/TN ratio) was greater in alfalfa fields than in abandoned and wheat fields. However, soil microbial biomass N (MBN) was similar among the studied fields, while MBN/TN ratio in wheat fields was higher than that in abandoned fields. Agricultural abandonment may result in enhanced soil N mineralization and, would maintain long-term fertility and productivity of the farmlands of semi-arid climates.},

We aimed to assess the efficacy of some contemporary by-products to provide nutrients to crops as well as the potential harm of adding toxic elements to the environment. Four different by-products widely available in Northern Europe were tested for their effects on two nutrient-poor agricultural soils in terms of increasing available macro- and micro-nutrients as well as toxic elements. Assessing soil microbial community as a sensitive tool for evaluating soil quality was conducted with the focus on microbial activity, carbon metabolism and on Rhizobium/Agrobacterium. Wood ash increased pH and CaEDTA, KEDTA and MgEDTA in the soils. The only increase in EDTA-extractable micronutrients in the soils was observed by applying pot ale, increasing Cu. None of the amendments increased the availability of Pb and Cd in the soils. Soils amended with the by-products thus remained similar to the unamended control but were quite different from fully mineral fertilised soils. There were no detectable adverse effects on the physiological and genetic profiles of microbial communities. The by-products were moderately beneficial and did not change the soil microbial community as much as the fully fertilised treatment with mineral fertilisers. Changes in the microbial community profiles were probably due to direct effects on microbes limited by K, Ca and N as opposed to indirect effects on plant growth. This is potentially significant in understanding how to improve impoverished and marginal soils as microbial activity affects many other ecosystem functions.},

According to an estimate, such practices will convert 30\% of the total world cultivated soil into degraded land by 2020. Soil structure and fertility loss are one of the main causes of soil degradation. They are also considered as a major threat to crop production and food security for future generations. Implementing safe and environmental friendly technology would be viable solution for achieving sustainable restoration of degraded soils. Bacterial and fungal inocula have a potential to reinstate the fertility of degraded land through various processes. These microorganisms increase the nutrient bioavailability through nitrogen fixation and mobilization of key nutrients (phosphorus, potassium and iron) to the crop plants while remediate soil structure by improving its aggregation and stability. Success rate of such inocula under field conditions depends on their antagonistic or synergistic interaction with indigenous microbes or their inoculation with organic fertilizers. Co-inoculation of bacteria and fungi with or without organic fertilizer are more beneficial for reinstating the soil fertility and organic matter content than single inoculum. Such factors are of great importance when considering bacteria and fungi inocula for restoration of degraded soils. The overview of presented mechanisms and interactions will help agriculturists in planning sustainable management strategy for reinstating the fertility of degraded soil and assist them in reducing the negative impact of artificial fertilizers on our environment.},

  abstract = {Understanding the origin of the carbon (C) stabilised in soils is crucial in order to device management practices that will foster C accumulation in soils. The relative contributions to soil C pools of roots vs. shoots is one aspect that has been mostly overlooked, although it appears a key factor that drives the fate of plant tissue C either as mineralized CO2 or as stabilized soil organic matter (SOM). Available studies on the subject consistently indicate that root C has a longer residence time in soil than shoot C. From the few studies with complete datasets, we estimated that the mean residence time in soils of root-derived C is 2.4 times that of shoot-derived C. Our analyses indicate that this value is biased neither by an underestimation of root contributions, as exudation was considered in the analysis, nor by a priming effect of shoot litter on SOM. Here, we discuss the main SOM stabilisation mechanisms with respect to their ability to specifically protect root-derived SOM. Comparing in situ and incubation experiments suggests that the higher chemical recalcitrance of root tissues as compared to that of shoots is responsible for only a small portion, i.e. about one fourth, of the difference in mean residence time in soils of root-derived vs. shootderived C. This suggests that SOM protection mechanisms other than chemical recalcitrance are also enhanced by root activities: (1) physico-chemical protection, especially in deeper horizons, (2) micrometer-scale physical protection through myccorhiza and root-hair activities, and (3) chemical interactions with metal ions. The impact of environmental conditions within deeper soil layers on root C stabilisation appear difficult to assess, but is likely, if anything, to further increase the ratio between the mean residence time of root vs. shoot C in soils. Future advances are expected from isotopic studies conducted at the molecular level, which will help unravel the fate of individual shoot and root compounds, such as cutins and suberins, throughout soil profiles.},

  abstract = {While soil microbial ecology, soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil physical quality are widely understood to be interrelated \textemdash{} the underlying drivers of emergent properties, from land management to biochemistry, are hotly debated. Biological binding agents, microbial exudates, or `extracellular polymeric substances' (EPS) in soil are now receiving increased attention due to several of the existing methodological challenges having been overcome. We applied a recently developed approach to quantify soil EPS, as extracellular protein and extracellular polysaccharide, on the well-characterised soils of the Highfield Experiment, Rothamsted Research, UK. Our aim was to investigate the links between agricultural land use, SOC, transient binding agents known as EPS, and their impacts on soil physical quality (given by mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates; MWD). We compared the legacy effects from long-term previous land-uses (unfertilised grassland, fertilised arable, and fallow) which were established~{$>~$}50~years prior to investigation, crossed with the same current land-uses established for a duration of only 2.5~years prior to sampling. Continuously fallow and grassland soils represented the poorest and greatest states of structural integrity, respectively. Total SOC and N were found to be affected by both previous and current land-uses, while extractable EPS and MWD were driven primarily by the current land-use. Land-use change between these two extremes (fallow~\textrightarrow ~grass; grass~\textrightarrow ~fallow) resulted in smaller SOC differences (64\% increase or 37\% loss) compared to MWD (125\% increase or 78\% loss). SOC concentration correlated well to MWD (adjusted R2~=~0.72) but the greater SOC content from previous grassland was not found to contribute directly to the current stability (p~{$<~$}0.05). Our work thus supports the view that certain distinct components of SOC, rather than the total pool, have disproportionately important effects on a soil's structural stability. EPS-protein was more closely related to aggregate stability than EPS-polysaccharide (p values of 0.002 and 0.027, respectively), and ranking soils with the 5 greatest concentrations of EPS-protein to their corresponding orders of stability (MWD) resulted in a perfect match. We confirmed that both EPS-protein and EPS-polysaccharide were transient fractions: supporting the founding models for aggregate formation. We suggest that management of transient binding agents such as EPS \textemdash as opposed to simply increasing the total SOC content\textemdash{} may be a more feasible strategy to improve soil structural integrity and help achieve environmental objectives.},

Our aim was to use quantitative data from a site in the Northern Great Plains, USA and a semi-quantitative literature search to demonstrate the robustness of soil stability as an indicator of ecosystem functioning. Empirical data included measurements of plant and soil properties along a local livestock grazing gradient to determine whether soil stability (e.g., \% water-stable aggregates) explained primary productivity and soil water transport for a mixed-grass prairie site in the Northern Great Plains. We measured: annual net primary productivity (ANPP), elevation, \% soil moisture, measures of soil stability, and soil water transport (field-saturated infiltrability and sorptivity) across points spanning a local gradient in livestock grazing intensity (none vs. light to moderate stocking rates; mean distance separating points = 39.9 m [range = 5.2\textendash 71.3 m]). Across the sampled gradient, variation in ANPP was best explained by a model with field-saturated infiltrability and \% soil moisture. Infiltrability explained slightly more of the variation. We then determined that moderate amounts of variation in infiltrability were explained by ANPP, \% soil moisture, and \% water-stable aggregates. We determined that most of this variation was explained by ANPP and then soil moisture. Our empirical findings indicate that plant production was correlated with infiltration though we could not determine whether variation in plant production was caused by variation in infiltration or vice versa. We generally failed to show that soil stability (e.g., \% water-stable aggregates) was a useful predictor of primary productivity and soil water transport. Our semi-quantitative literature review also indicated that soil stability was not a consistent predictor of either plant production or infiltration. The varying evidence reported here on whether soil stability is a predictor of ecosystem function illustrates the difficulty in identifying an indicator of ecosystem health that (1) is a predictor of ecosystem function across grassland types, (2) is sensitive to rangeland management, and (3) can be easily implemented by non-experts.},

Adding an easily available C source, like glucose, has therefore been a common approach to study alleviation of resource limitations. Most such studies have relied on respiration to study microbial dynamics, with few following the explicit growth response. We determined the response in bacterial and fungal growth, as well as respiration, to additions of glucose (0.5e32 mg C g\`A1 soil) during up to 6 days, using leucine incorporation for bacterial growth and acetate-in-ergosterol incorporation for fungal growth. A concentration of 2 mg glucose-C g\`A1 soil, where the fungal contribution appeared to be small, was also studied with a high time resolution. Adding glucose resulted in an initial lag phase of stable respiration and bacterial growth. Bacterial growth was similar to the unamended control, while respiration was 8 fold higher during this period. The 14-h lag phase was followed by an exponential increase for both respiration and bacterial growth, with a similar intrinsic growth rate (m) of around 0.25 h\`A1. After the exponential phase, bacterial growth decreased exponentially. The respiration initially decreased even more rapidly than bacterial growth. At concentrations exceeding 4 mg glucose-C g\`A1 the relative stimulation of fungal growth surpassed that of bacteria, with the highest amendment rates, 32 mg C g\`A1, resulting in mainly fungal growth. Lower loading rates than 4 mg glucose-C g\`A1 appeared to stimulate mainly bacterial growth.},

The sensitivity of Cmin to fluctuating moisture depended on temperature. However, the Q10 was not significantly affected by soil moisture. We fitted a multiple polynomial model that predicted Cmin as a multiplicative function of temperature and moisture (R2 {$>$} 0.99). 3 The response of Cmin of soil to rewetting after 1 and 24 hours. In all cases, the response was rapid. The soil incubated at 60\% WHC or less responded positively to a sudden increase in water content, with the largest increase in the 20\% WHC treatment. The model predicted Cmin in the field well when rewetting effects were taken into account (R2 {$>$} 0.81). These results indicate that sudden changes in soil moisture can lead to increased carbon mineralization during the dry summer. It is necessary to include such responses in models as they may represent a substantial loss of carbon in the overall carbon balance of Mediterranean ecosystems.},

A strong increase of the CO2-C emissions relative to the unamended soil (control) was observed after soil application of all five organic-fertilizer treatments. A significantly higher amount of applied C was lost in hen-manure treatment (648 mg CO2-C [g C applied]\textendash 1) when compared to compost (159 mg CO2-C [g C applied]\textendash 1) or to the three combined treatments (176\textendash 195 mg CO2-C [g C applied]\textendash 1). The first-order exponential model and the double exponential model were used to fit the C-mineralization data in the treatments considered. Results showed that mixing ``small'' amounts of hen manure with compost did not affect the total amount of potentially mineralizable C, but significantly increased the mineralization rate constant. Clearly, combinations of both fertilizers promoted an initial faster mineralization of the organic matter, and consequently a faster release of nutrients, without affecting the total amount of C sequestered in soil.},

Cover crops significantly increased saturated hydraulic conductivity, acid-extractable heavy-fraction carbohydrates (those in soil denser than 1.7 g/mL), and macroaggregate slaking resistance over clean-cultivated or herbicide treatments. Heavy-fraction carbohydrates are probably mainly composed of microbial extracellular polysaccharides produced in response to cover-crop C inputs. Heavy-fraction carbohydrates were significantly correlated with aggregate stability and saturated hydraulic conductivity, while total organic C and light-fraction carbohydrates were not. There were no differences between soil under herbicide and clean-cultivation treatments, showing that tillage alone did not measurably affect carbohydrate or soil structure.

  abstract = {Bacterial and fungal growth rate measurements are sensitive variables to detect changes in environmental conditions. However, while considerable progress has been made in methods to assess the species composition and biomass of fungi and bacteria, information about growth rates remains surprisingly rudimentary. We review the recent history of approaches to assess bacterial and fungal growth rates, leading up to current methods, especially focusing on leucine/thymidine incorporation to estimate bacterial growth and acetate incorporation into ergosterol to estimate fungal growth. We present the underlying assumptions for these methods, compare estimates of turnover times for fungi and bacteria based on them, and discuss issues, including for example elusive conversion factors. We review what the application of fungal and bacterial growth rate methods has revealed regarding the influence of the environmental factors of temperature, moisture (including drying/rewetting), pH, as well as the influence of substrate additions, the presence of plants and toxins. We highlight experiments exploring the competitive and facilitative interaction between bacteria and fungi enabled using growth rate methods. Finally, we predict that growth methods will be an important complement to molecular approaches to elucidate fungal and bacterial ecology, and we identify methodological concerns and how they should be addressed.},

However, this is a challenging task due to the occurrence of many different processes contributing to litter biomass loss. With the aim of quantifying different fluxes of C lost by leaf litter decomposition, a field experiment was performed at a short rotation coppice poplar plantation in central Italy. Populus nigra leaf litter, enriched in 13C ({$\delta$}13C {$\sim$} +160\textperthousand ) was placed within collars to decompose in direct contact with the soil ({$\delta$}13C {$\sim$} -26\textperthousand ) for 11 months. CO2 efflux from within the collars and its isotopic composition were determined at monthly intervals. After 11 months, remaining litter and soil profiles (0-20 cm) were sampled and analysed for their total C and 13C content. Gas chromatography (GC), GC-mass spectrometry (MS) and GC-combustion-isotope ratio (GC/C/IRMS) were used to analyse phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) extracted from soil samples to identify the groups of soil micro-organisms that had incorporated litter-derived C and to determine the quantity of C incorporated by the soil microbial biomass (SMB). By the end of the experiment, the litter had lost about 80\% of its original weight. The fraction of litter C lost as an input into the soil (67 {$\pm$} 12\% of the total C loss) was found to be twice as much as the fraction released as CO2 to the atmosphere (30 {$\pm$} 3\%), thus demonstrating the importance of quantifying litter-derived C input to soils, in litter decomposition studies. The mean {$\delta$}13C values of PLFAs in soil ({$\delta$}13C = -12.5\textperthousand ) showed sustained incorporation of litter-derived C after one year (7.8 {$\pm$} 1.6\% of total PLFA-C). Thus, through the application of stable 13C isotope analyses, we have quantified two major C fluxes contributing to litter decomposition, at macroscopic and microscopic levels. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In burned and control soils total and active fungal mycelium, microbial biomass C, percentage of microbial biomass C present as fungal C, metabolic quotient (qCO2) and coefficient of endogenous mineralisation (CEM) were assayed together with several chemical properties of soil (i.e. pH and contents of organic C, total and mineral N, available K, Mg, Mn and water). Fire significantly decreased the fungal mycelium, whereas it stimulated microbial growth probably through the enhancement of bacterial growth because of the increase in organic C and nutrient contents in burned plots. This shift in microbial community composition might explain the observed reduction in soil microbial efficiency of C assimilation (high qCO2) and the increase in C mineralisation rate (CEM) in the first 84 days after fire. Therefore, fire might increase CO2 input to the atmosphere not only during combustion phase but also in the post-fire period. \textcopyright{} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {In this paper we evaluate the utility of ergosterol as a measure of fungal biomass in temperate soils. We summarise published findings and compare them with data from our own broad-scale assessment of the relationship between ergosterol and ATP in a range of temperate soils. Two hundred and ninety five plots (three cores taken from each 10 x 10 m plot) in seven ecotypes were sampled. Soils ranged from entirely mineral to entirely organic (0.01-46\% C(org)) and sites comprised two primary successions, one on shingle ridge on the south coast of England and one in the slack of a dune blow-out on the south coast of Wales, various meadow, pasture (some restored after opencast mining) and ancient woodland soils throughout England and acid forest soils in Central Europe. We found a strong relationship between ergosterol and ATP (r2 = 0.80), which was largely unaffected by the key soil properties of C(org), C/N ratio, moisture and pH. The sources and implications of the 20\% of residual variance were explored by assuming that the error was compounded from three sources: the inaccuracies in methods of analysis of ergosterol and ATP, the failings of each of the variables to estimate their underlying populations (i.e., fungal and total biomass, respectively) (e(var)), and the non-equivalence of these populations (i.e., their incomplete overlap) (e(pop). By partitioning the residual variance into components corresponding to the levels of sampling, we estimated that the sum of the systematic portions of e(var) and e(pop) formed as much as three quarters of the 20\% of residual variance in the ATP-ergosterol correlation, leaving just 5\% mostly due to random error. Despite this close relationship, the attainment of a universal conversion factor between ergosterol and fungal biomass, applicable to all temperate soils, remains elusive and problematic. Many problems are caused by a lack of comparability between the various measures of fungal and total biomass used and the reliability, or otherwise, of extrapolations based on measures of axenic cultures (in contrast to in-situ measurements). The issue is further complicated by the non-linearity of the relationship between fungal biomass and fungal surface area; ergosterol is more correctly an index of the latter since it is a principal membrane sterol. We conclude that ergosterol is likely to be a reliable indicator of the extent of fungal membranes in temperate soils, if not an accurate measure of fungal biomass. \textcopyright{} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

However, only few data exist on rates of soil C sequestration or the fate of added C in grassland soils, which are generally thought to have high C storage potential. We measured changes in the amount of C and nitrogen (N) in soils and in the composition of soil organic matter (SOM) following a single application of composted organic matter in two annual grasslands from different bioclimatic zones (coastal and inland valley). There was a significant increase in bulk soil organic C content at the valley grassland, and a similar but non-significant trend at the coastal grassland. Physical fractionation of soil three years after organic matter amendment revealed increases in C and N in the free- and occluded light fractions in both the valley and coastal grasslands. Amendments resulted in a greater relative increase in the N stored in light soil fractions compared to C, leading to lower C:N ratios. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy showed an increase in the ratio of carboxyl and carbonyl functional groups to aliphatic methyl and methylene groups in the free- and occluded light fractions. These data show that the organic matter amendment was incorporated in the free light and occluded light fractions over three years. Our results indicate that a single application of compost to grassland soils can increase soil C and N storage in labile and physically protected pools over relatively short time periods and contribute to climate change mitigation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Samples of 16 soils from major mineralogical classes of New Zealand pastures and providing a range of organic C, clay contents and surface area, were incubated with 14C-labelled glucose for 35 d. The amounts of 12CO2 and 14CO2 evolved during incubation were monitored and the residual 14C concentrations determined. Periodically, the samples were removed and microbial biomass 12C and 14C determined using the fumigation-extraction technique. System mean residence times (MRTs) were obtained by three independent methods: (i) a compartmental model using 14C microbial biomass data, (ii) a non-compartmental model using 14C microbial biomass data and (iii) a biexponential equation as an empirical equation from residual 14C data. The eect of soil characteristics on MRTs was compared. The 14CO2 respired, after 35 d incubation, accounted for 51 to 66\% of the glucose 14C input to these soils. The soils diered signi\textregistered cantly in their amounts of 14CO2 evolution and in the proportions of labelled 14C in the biomass. The extent of mineralization of 14C-labelled glucose was in\textasciimacron uenced by soil clay content and clay surface area. Soils of low clay content (3{$\pm$}12\%) had high biophysical quotients (respired: residual 14C); the highest (1.93) was in the soil with least clay (3\%) and lowest mineral surface area, suggesting that clay is eective in C stabilization immediately after substrate assimilation. A biexponential model was found to be suitable for describing changes in the residual 14C and microbial biomass 14C during the 35 d glucose decomposition for most of the soils. MRTs for microbial biomass 14C were correlated with clay content (P {$<$} 0.001), surface area estimated by para-nitrophenol ( pNP) (P {$<$} 0.003) and pH (P {$<$} 0.01). Our results also showed that the MRTs of microbially assimilated 14C are similar despite dierences in the chemical nature of the applied 14C-labelled substrate. However, the MRT for humus 14C diered with the chemical nature of the applied substrate. Clay and surface area played a major role in controlling the decomposition of added substrate through the stabilization and protection of the microbial biomass. \# 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In addition, the effect of the fungal:bacterial biomass ratio on the relationship between CO2 evolution and the size of the soil microbial biomass was examined. Soil samples were collected from three experimental fields amended with various organic materials (Yatsugatake, Ibaraki, and Tochigi fields). The range of the fungal:bacterial biomass ratio in the Yatsugatake and Ibaraki fields was small (1.54-2.24 and 1.11-1.71, respectively), but it was large in the Tochigi field (1.18-3.75). We found a high negative correlation between this ratio and the metabolic quotient (qCO(2)=2.10-0.361 (fungal:bacterial biomass ratio), R=-0.851, P{$<$}0.01) in the Tochigi field. Therefore, we suggest that qCO(2) decreases with an increase in the fungal:bacterial biomass ratio, which may be due to a higher efficiency of substrate C use by fungal flora in comparison with bacterial flora. In the Yatsugatake and Ibaraki fields, there was a high positive correlation between CO2 evolution and total microbial biomass. In contrast, no correlation was observed between these two parameters in the Tochigi field, probably reflecting the wide range of values for the fungal:bacterial biomass ratio. From the results obtained, we suggest that the fungal:bacterial biomass ratio is an important factor regulating the relationship between CO, evolution and the size of the microbial biomass.},

However, few soil C models consider these transitions. We hypothesized that microbes' capacity to enter and exit dormancy in response to unfavorable and favorable environmental conditions decreases the sensitivity of microbial biomass and cumulative respiration to environmental stress. To test this hypothesis, we collected data from a rewetting experiment and used it to design and parameterize dormancy in an existing microbe-based soil C model. Then we compared predictions of microbial biomass and soil heterotrophic respiration (RH) under simulated cycles of stressful (dryness) and favorable (wet pulses) conditions. Because the influence of moisture on microbial processes in soil generally depends on temperature, we collected data and tested predictions at different temperatures. When dormancy was not taken into account, simulated microbial biomass and cumulative microbial respiration over five years were lower and decreased faster under lengthening drying-wetting cycles. Differences due to dormancy increased with temperature and with the length of the dry periods between wetting events. We conclude that ignoring both the capacity of microbes to enter and exit dormancy in response to the environment and the consequences of these metabolic responses for soil C cycling results in predictions of unrealistically low RH under warming and dryingwetting cycles.},

We manipulated the composition of soil fauna in mesh bags with various mesh sizes (5, 45, and 1,000~\textmu m) to exclude faunal groups based on body size. Our experiment indicated that feeding and foraging activity of nematodes and enchytraeids modified the physical\textendash chemical properties of the soil and had long-term effects on soil bacterial community composition (measured by denaturing gel electrophoresis, colony-forming unit counts, and phospholipid fatty acid pattern). However, microbial enzyme (phosphomonoesterase, butyrate-esterase, \ss -glucosidase, N-acetyl-glucosamidase, and \ss -cellobiosidase) activities (measured by fluorogenic model substrates), decomposition rate of woody and cellulose material, or C and N status of the soil were not altered by the faunal treatment. Instead, enzyme activity was reduced by soil drying. Our results give support to ideas that functional redundancy is a common characteristic of the soil organisms, but no support was found for the idea that the community composition of soil decomposers had a strong link to the regulation of C and N cycles in the soil.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved. The soil food web plays a fundamental role in ensuring key ecosystem processes, maintaining soil fertility and improving soil suppressiveness to soil-borne diseases. The composition and structure of the soil food web reflect the health and condition of soils, and the effects of soil management \textendash{} including the use of pesticides, fertilizers, tillage, crop rotation and cover crops \textendash{} on soil functioning and services which can be assessed by the use of soil food web indicators. My presentation focuses on how the assessment of the nature, diversity and the structure of nematode communities allow diagnosing the status of the soil food web and hence soil health. As main components of the soil microfauna involved at different trophic levels and functional guilds, soil nematode communities \textendash{} including free-living nematodes \textendash{} provide unique ecological data on soil processes. The high abundance and the large functional and taxonomic diversity of soil nematodes permit the calculation of a number of indicators of soil food web diversity, maturity and condition. The diversity and biomass of nematodes at different trophic levels can be related to different ecosystem services. Nematodes participate in various soil nutrient and energy channels. Bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes are used as indicators of the soil food web mineralization service, and indices derived from their abundances and biomass are related to plant productivity and crop yield, while plant-feeding nematodes are used as indicators of below-ground pest pressure. Nematodes from higher functional guilds, i.e., predators and omnivores, act as natural enemies of below-ground pests, and have been found to be excellent indicators of soil suppressiveness to introduced herbivore prey. The joint assessment of such three components of the food web, largely facilitated by recent online tools, allows an integral diagnosis of soil health, as well as the on-farm assessment of the effects of crop management on soil functioning. Soil fertility and soil suppressiveness can be promoted by an adequate soil management able to enhance the diversity and the abundance of soil food web organisms.},

Soil MBN was similar between ORG, TRA and NV in the surface layer. The lowest values for soil MBC and MBN were observed in CON plot. Soil microbial biomass increased gradually from conventional to organic farming, leading to consistent and distinct differences from the conventional control by the end of the second year.},

In this study, both initial substrate-induced respiration (SIR) rates and substrate-induced growth responses to nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) additions were investigated together because the two approaches had been assessed separately in previous studies. A wide range of Japanese, Thai and Kazakh soils with different land uses were used, including acidic Japanese forest soils with low N availability, which has not been fully examined. We hypothesized that microbes in Japanese forest soils would mainly respond to N addition. The results showed that N addition decreased initial SIR rates to 75\textendash 87\% for the acidic Japanese and Thai forest soils probably due to the increases in substrate C use efficiencies, but had no effect for other soils. P addition tended to increase initial SIR rates. In addition, P but not N addition resulted in the increases of specific microbial growth rates for all tested soils. In conclusion, soil microbes responded to P addition with enhanced their growth rates and initial SIR rates, whereas they responded to N addition with reduced initial SIR rates probably through efficient use of C only for the Japanese and Thai forest soils. Therefore, nitrogen availability will have a crucial role in microbial use of substrate C especially for acidic forest soils with low N availability.},

  abstract = {A major thrust of terrestrial microbial ecology is focused on understanding when and how the composition of the microbial community affects the functioning of biogeochemical processes at the ecosystem scale (meters-to-kilometers and days-to-years). While research has demonstrated these linkages for physiologically and phylogenetically "narrow" processes such as trace gas emissions and nitrification, there is less conclusive evidence that microbial community composition influences the "broad" processes of decomposition and organic matter (OM) turnover in soil. In this paper, we consider how soil microbial community structure influences C cycling. We consider the phylogenetic level at which microbes form meaningful guilds, based on overall life history strategies, and suggest that these are associated with deep evolutionary divergences, while much of the species-level diversity probably reflects functional redundancy.We then consider under what conditions it is possible for differences among microbes to affect process dynamics, and argue that while microbial community structure may be important in the rate of OM breakdown in the rhizosphere and in detritus, it is likely not important in the mineral soil. In mineral soil, physical access to occluded or sorbed substrates is the rate-limiting process. Microbial community influences on OM turnover in mineral soils are based on how organisms allocate the C they take up - not only do the fates of the molecules differ, but they can affect the soil system differently as well. For example, extracellular enzymes and extracellular polysaccharides can be key controls on soil structure and function. How microbes allocate C may also be particularly important for understanding the long-term fate of C in soil - is it sequestered or not? \textcopyright{} 2012 Schimel and Schaeffer.},

The soil microbiota, existing in extremely high density and diversity, rapidly modify the energetic performance and activity rates to changing environmental conditions. Thus, the microbial consortium possesses the ability to accommodate environmental constraints by adjusting (i) activity rates, (ii) biomass, and (iii) community structure. These parameters are particularly important to take into consideration when evaluating soil quality.

  abstract = {The substrate availability for microbial biomass (MB) in soil is crucial for microbial biomass activity. Due to the fast microbial decomposition and the permanent production of easily available substrates in the rooted top soil mainly by plants during photosynthesis, easily available substrates make a very important contribution to many soil processes including soil organic matter turnover, microbial growth and maintenance, aggregate stabilization, CO2 efflux, etc. Naturally occurring concentrations of easily available substances are low, ranging from 0.1 mM in soils free of roots and plant residues to 80 mM in root cells. We investigated the effect of adding 14C-labelled glucose at concentrations spanning the 6 orders of magnitude naturally occurring concentrations on glucose uptake and mineralization by microbial biomass. A positive correlation between the amount of added glucose and its portion mineralized to CO2 was observed: After 22 days, from 26\% to 44\% of the added 0.0009 to 257 mg glucose C g\`A1 soil was mineralized. The dependence of glucose mineralization on its amount can be described with two functions. Up to 2.6 mg glucose C g\`A1 soil (corresponds to 0.78\% of initial microbial biomass C), glucose mineralization increased with the slope of 1.8\% more mineralized glucose C per 1 mg C added, accompanied by an increasing incorporation of glucose C into MB. An increased spatial contact between microorganisms and glucose molecules with increasing concentration may be responsible for this fast increase in mineralization rates (at glucose additions {$<$}2.6 mg C g\`A1). At glucose additions higher than 2.6 mg C g\`A1 soil, however, the increase of the glucose mineralization per 1 mg added glucose was much smaller as at additions below 2.6 mg C g\`A1 soil and was accompanied by decreasing portions of glucose 14C incorporated into microbial biomass. This supports the hypothesis of decreasing efficiency of glucose utilization by MB in response to increased substrate availability in the range 2.6\textendash 257 mg C g\`A1 ({$\frac{1}{4}$}0.78\textendash 78\% of microbial biomass C). At low glucose amounts, it was mainly stored in a chloroform-labile microbial pool, but not readily mineralized to CO2. The addition of 257 mg glucose C g\`A1 soil (0.78 mg C glucose mg\`A1 C micro-organisms) caused a lag phase in mineralization of 19 h, indicating that glucose mineralization was not limited by the substrate availability but by the amount of MB which is typical for 2nd order kinetics.},

Moreover, we employed metaproteomics to investigate the influence of environmental factors and nutrients on the decomposer structure and function during beech litter decomposition. Litter was collected at forest sites in Austria with different litter nutrient content. Proteins were analyzed by 1-D-SDS-PAGE followed by liquid-chromatography and tandem mass-spectrometry. Mass spectra were assigned to phylogenetic and functional groups by a newly developed bioinformatics workflow, assignments being validated by complementary approaches. We provide evidence that the litter nutrient content and the stoichiometry of C:N:P affect the decomposer community structure and activity. Fungi were found to be the main producers of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, with no bacterial hydrolases being detected by our metaproteomics approach. Detailed investigation of microbial succession suggests that it is influenced by litter nutrient content. Microbial activity was stimulated at higher litter nutrient contents via a higher abundance and activity of extracellular enzymes.},

  abstract = {Organic-mineral soil particles are formed and altered as a result of pedogenic processes and anthropogenic impacts on soils. They can be isolated from bulk soil samples by physical disaggregation followed by particle size and/or density fractionation. This review summarizes methodological advances and the characteristic features of the chemical composition of organic matter in these different fractions. It is demonstrated how soil texture and soil genesis determine the contents of organic C (C-org) in size-separates and their distribution in typical profiles of four important major soil groups. Data from numerous field studies were compiled to show that the proportions of C(or)g bound in clay fractions increased under soil uses which reduce the soil organic matter (SOM) content. Coarser and lighter particles are relatively enriched in native or manured soils. Contents of humic substances, lignin oxidation products, carbohydrates, lipids, and forms of organic N determined by wet-chemical methods indicate that the chemical composition results from specific functions of the organic-mineral particles in the turnover of SOM. This is also reflected by C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance and analytical pyrolysis, the applications of which to the study of organic-mineral particles are summarized and compared for the first time. The summarized chemical characteristics of organic-mineral particles have direct effects on other properties such as soil aggregation and the resulting physical behaviour of soil. Moreover, the adsorption and distribution of plant nutrients, as well as the binding capacity for a wide range of pollutants, clearly show that the organic matter is a key factor for the physicochemical reactions at organic-mineral surfaces. Along with evidence for the different mineralizability of C-org and organic N, and enzymatic properties, the accumulated knowledge of their composition, structure and properties provides a basis from which to develop molecular models of organic-mineral particles. Molecular modelling and visualization of humic colloids, SOM and its complexes (organic-mineral particles) with biological substances, metals and xenobiotics are discussed. These model complexes offer a basis for the conceptual development of SOM macromolecules, mineral soil particles and the computer-assisted design of organic-mineral particles. Molecular-mechanics calculations and geometrical optimization are employed to obtain energy minimized, stable conformations which allow the determination of atomic distances, bonds, angles, torsions, stretches, etc., at nanochemical level. As a result, exact descriptions of three-dimensional structures can be proposed. The total (potential) energy of the organic matter complexes and macromolecules can be determined simultaneously, and energy derivatives for bond-, angle-, dihedral-, van der Waals', stretch-bend, and electrostatic energies calculated. Moreover, quantitative structure-activity relationship software is employed to calculate relevant molecular properties such as surface, volume, atomic charges, polarizability, refractivity, etc. It is this combination of atomic/molecular structural data and energy derivatives that opens up new insights into binding sites and transport forms between biological and/or xenobiotic substances and SOM. The resulting potential, and limits, for modelling of organic (humic) macromolecules, organic-mineral particles and mineral surfaces are delineated. References: 171},

  abstract = {Genesis of soil organic matter (SOM) during pedogenesis is still a matter of controversy in soil science. Recently, it was hypothesized that microbial cell-envelope fragments contribute significantly to SOM formation. We tested the relevance of this process during pedogenesis by evaluating the development of SOM along a chronosequence of a glacier forefield (Damma glacier). Samples of increasing soil age collected along the forefield were analyzed for C and N contents, phospholipid and total fatty acids (PLFA and tFA), water contact angle, micro-hydrophobicity and surface coverage by microbial cell-envelope residues. The surface coverage was visualized and quantified by analysis of representative, equally-scaled scanning electron micrographs (SEM). Increasing SOM contents were accompanied by increasing coverage and overall abundance of microbial cell-envelope fragments as evaluated on the basis of scanning electron microscopy; this is also reflected in the amounts of tFA and PLFA, the trend of C/N ratios, and the increasing hydrophobicity and water contact angles of the soil samples. Using SEM and the image analysis approach, we can provide a process-based description of the development of SOM in the newly developing ecosystem of the glacier forefield. The majority of small-sized SOM visible with scanning electron microscopy appears to consist of bacterial cell envelope fragments that remain stable after cell death, such that their shape does not change with soil age. Our results show the importance of microbial processing of SOM, and highlight the existence of microbial necromass as a significant part of the fine-particulate SOM even in later stages of soil development.},

Unexpectedly, the microbial populations and DGGE profiles in the soils treated with cattle manure did not differ significantly from the controls. Although the microbial populations in the soils amended with green manure were significantly higher throughout the two-year experiment, differences in the DGGE band profiles were minor. A principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated a succession of differences in the DGGE pro-files, as the application of green manure slightly affected the fungal community. Principal component and sequence analyses for characteristic DGGE bands identified close relatives of Chaetomium globosum, Fusarium oxysporum, and Mortierella alpina which appeared to be involved with the decomposition of green manure. These results suggested that the application of green manure was more effective at increasing microbial popula-tions than that of cattle manure, and activated several characteristic fungi which should be considered to play a significant role in the decomposition of green manure.},

But their benefits with regard to soil quality are undisputed. However, only few studies have focused on emissions of greenhouse gases from soil enriched with organic residues. A microcosom approach was employed to investigate the influence of the origin and composition of various organic residues on mineralization and N2O and CO2 emissions in an arable soil. In total, we set up six treatments: control, poultry manure, bio-waste compost, sheep and wheat straw compost, cow manure (CM) and for further comparison, the mineral fertilizer calcium ammonium nitrate. 500~g of sieved and homogenized soil was mixed with the amendments and packed into microcosms. After a pre-incubation period of 10~days, gas concentrations were measured periodically from the headspace of the microcosm by means of an airtight surgical syringe. The measurement period continued for 32~days. Soil amended with CM showed a significantly ({$\alpha~$}=~0.05) higher cumulative CO2 emission (914~mg~kg-1) followed by bio-waste compost than poultry manure, sheep waste compost, control and calcium ammonium nitrate. Amending soil with cow manure and poultry manure led to the highest N2O-N emissions (110~\textmu g~kg-1). However, poultry manure and calcium ammonium nitrate significantly enhanced mineralization and net nitrification. Amendment of sheep and wheat straw compost and cow manure led to C sequestration and reduced N2O emission. Soil pH greatly decreased with poultry manure, sheep and wheat straw compost and bio-waste compost. Summing up, the application of organic residues to soil has some disadvantageous environmental effects calling for further research.},

  abstract = {Crop residue addition is a way to increase soil organic matter (SOM) level in croplands. However, organic matter input and SOM stocks are not linearly related. Consequently, adding high amounts of residues, such as straw, may increase SOM to only a small extent, and an alternative use of the residues may be justified. The objective of this study was to test how the level and type (above- or belowground) of residue addition affect SOM stabilization. We hypothesise that (1) root residues will be mineralised slower than leaf and stalk residues, (2) soil aggregate formation will increase with high additions, and (3) wheat residue addition will induce positive priming, with the magnitude depending on the residue level and type. Homogeneously 13C-labelled wheat residues (leaves, stalks, roots) were added to a silt-loam soil at levels of 1.40 and 5.04~g~DM~kg-~1 and CO2 release and {$\delta$}13C signature were measured over 64~days at 20~\textdegree C. Water-stable macroaggregates ({$>~$}250~{$\mu$}m), microaggregates (53\textendash 250~{$\mu$}m) and silt plus clay size fractions ({$<~$}53~{$\mu$}m) were separated and 13C incorporation from residue was quantified in each fraction after 64~days. Aggregate formation generally increased with added residue amount, but the proportion of residues occluded within aggregates decreased with increasing addition level. The occlusion of residues from aboveground biomass was more reduced with addition level than that of roots. Residue mineralisation increased with the addition level, but this increase was less for roots compared to stalks and leaves. Priming effects were similar between residue types and mainly depended on the added amount: SOM mineralisation increased by 50\% and 90\% at low and high addition levels, respectively. We conclude that the proportion of residues physically protected within aggregates decreases and priming effects increase with increasing C input leading to decreasing rate of long-term C stabilization within SOM by increasing residue addition.},

  abstract = {Mulching is widely used to increase crop yield in semiarid regions in northwestern China, but little is known about the effect of different mulching systems on the microbial properties of the soil, which play an important role in agroecosystemic functioning and nutrient cycling. Based on a 4-year spring maize (Zea mays L.) field experiment at Changwu Agricultural and Ecological Experimental Station, Shaanxi, we evaluated the responses of soil microbial activity and crop to various management systems. The treatments were NMC (no mulching with inorganic N fertilizer), GMC (gravel mulching with inorganic N fertilizer), FMC (plastic-film mulching with inorganic N fertilizer) and FMO (plastic-film mulching with inorganic N fertilizer and organic manure addition). The results showed that the FMO soil had the highest contents of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, dehydrogenase activity, microbial activity and Shannon diversity index. The relative use of carbohydrates and amino acids by microbes was highest in the FMO soil, whereas the relative use of polymers, phenolic compounds and amines was highest in the soil in the NMC soil. Compared with the NMC, an increased but no significant trend of biomass production and nitrogen accumulation was observed under the GMC treatment. The FMC and FMO led a greater increase in biomass production than GMC and NMC. Compare with the NMC treatment, FMC increased grain yield, maize biomass and nitrogen accumulation by 62.2, 62.9 and 86.2\%, but no significant difference was found between the FMO and FMC treatments. Some soil biological properties, i.e. microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, being sensitive to the mulching and organic fertilizer, were significant correlated with yield and nitrogen availability. Film mulching over gravel mulching can serve as an effective measure for crop production and nutrient cycling, and plus organic fertilization additions may thus have improvements in the biological quality of the soil and its sustainability in the rainfall-limited semiarid region.},

  abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of soil microbial biomass and N dynamics following turfgrass clipping addition is central to understanding turfgrass ecology. New leaves represent a strong sink for soil and fertilizer N, and when mowed, a significant addition to soil organic N. Understanding the mineralization dynamics of clipping N should help in developing strategies to minimize N losses via leaching and denitrification. We characterized soil microbial biomass and N mineralization and immobilization turnover in response to clipping addition in a turfgrass chronosequence (i.e. 3, 8, 25, and 97yr old) and the adjacent native pines. Our objectives were (1) to evaluate the impacts of indigenous soil and microbial attributes associated with turf age and land use on the early phase decomposition of turfgrass clippings and (2) to estimate mineralization dynamics of turfgrass clippings and subsequent effects on N mineralization of indigenous soils. We conducted a 28-d laboratory incubation to determine short-term dynamics of soil microbial biomass, C decomposition, N mineralization and nitrification after soil incorporation of turfgrass clippings. Gross rates of N mineralization and immobilization were estimated with 15N using a numerical model, FLAUZ. Turfgrass clippings decomposed rapidly; decomposition and mineralization equivalent to 20\textendash 30\% of clipping C and N, respectively, occurred during the incubation. Turfgrass age had little effect on decomposition and net N mineralization. However, the response of potential nitrification to clipping addition was age dependent. In young turfgrass systems having low rates, potential nitrification increased significantly with clipping addition. In contrast, old turfgrass systems having high initial rates of potential nitrification were unaffected by clipping addition. Isotope 15N modeling showed that gross N mineralization following clipping addition was not affected by turf age but differed between turfgrass and the adjacent native pines. The flush of mineralized N following clipping addition was derived predominantly from the clippings rather than soil organic N. Our data indicate that the response of soil microbial biomass and N mineralization and immobilization to clipping addition was essentially independent of indigenous soil and microbial attributes. Further, increases in microbial biomass and activity following clipping addition did not stimulate the mineralization of indigenous soil organic N.},

  abstract = {Previous studies showed that the respiration flush upon rapid rewetting of dry soil decreases with increasing number of drying and rewetting (DRW) cycles which is thought to be due to various factors, for example, lower substrate availability or microbial biomass or changes in microbial community structure. To investigate if the reduction of respiration flush with increasing cycle number is due to lack of available substrate upon rewetting, incubation experiments with four DRW cycles were conducted where glucose solutions of different concentrations, low (50{$\mu$}gCg-1 soil), medium (250{$\mu$}gCg-1 soil) and high (500{$\mu$}gCg-1 soil) were added either in all four cycles or only in cycle 1, 2, 3 or 4 (the other cycles rewetted with water). Additional treatments included a constantly moist control (CM, 70\% of maximum water-holding capacity) and DRW treatments with only RO water. When dry soil was rewetted only with RO water, the respiration flush upon rewetting was about twice as high in the first two cycles than in cycles 3 and 4. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) one day after rewetting remained stable until cycle 3 after which it decreased by about 20\%. In all glucose treatments, the glucose-induced increase in respiration rate was greater in earlier than later cycles, irrespective of whether glucose was added to one cycle only or in all cycles. But when expressed relative to CM, the respiration rate was greater in the last two cycles. Single glucose addition increased MBC only in the cycle in which it was added whereas repeated glucose addition increased MBC over time. Glucose addition and DRW increased the metabolic quotient, thus reduced C use efficiency. In treatments with glucose added in all four cycles, the metabolic quotient increased with DRW cycle number which indicates lower efficiency in later cycles. It is concluded that lower substrate availability can be one of the reasons for the decrease in respiration flush upon rewetting with cycle number.},

CUE determines energy and material flows to higher trophic levels, conversion of plant-produced carbon into microbial products and rates of ecosystem carbon storage. Thermodynamic calculations support a maximum CUE value of \textasciitilde{} 0.60 (CUE max). Kinetic and stoichiometric constraints on microbial growth suggest that CUE in multi-resource limited natural systems should approach \textasciitilde{} 0.3 (CUE max /2). However, the mean CUE values reported for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems differ by twofold (\textasciitilde{} 0.26 vs. \textasciitilde{} 0.55) because the methods used to estimate CUE in aquatic and terrestrial systems generally differ and soil estimates are less likely to capture the full maintenance costs of community metabolism given the difficulty of measurements in water-limited environments. Moreover, many simulation models lack adequate representation of energy spilling pathways and stoichiometric constraints on metabolism, which can also lead to overestimates of CUE. We recommend that broad-scale models use a CUE value of 0.30, unless there is evidence for lower values as a result of pervasive nutrient limitations. Ecosystem models operating at finer scales should consider resource composition, stoichiometric constraints and biomass composition, as well as environmental drivers, to predict the CUE of microbial communities.},

On a whole soil basis, fine iPOM C was on average 51\% less in CT than in NT, and accounted for 21\% of the total C difference between NT and CT. The concentration of free LF C was not affected by tillage, but was on average 45\% less in the cultivated systems than NV. Proportions of crop-derived C in macroaggregates were similar in NT and CT, but were three times greater in microaggregates from NT than microaggregates from CT. We suggest that a faster turnover rate of macroaggregates in CT compared with NT leads to a slower rate of microaggregate formation within macroaggregates and less stabilization of new SOM in free microaggregates under CT.},

  abstract = {The relationship between soil structure and the ability of soil to stabilize soil organic matter (SOM) is a key element in soil C dynamics that has either been overlooked or treated in a cursory fashion when developing SOM models. The purpose of this paper is to review current knowledge of SOM dynamics within the framework of a newly proposed soil C saturation concept. Initially, we distinguish SOM that is protected against decomposition by various mechanisms from that which is not protected from decomposition. Methods of quantification and characteristics of three SOM pools defined as protected are discussed. Soil organic matter can be: (1) physically stabilized, or protected from decomposition, through microaggregation, or (2) intimate association with silt and clay particles, and (3) can be biochemically stabilized through the formation of recalcitrant SOM compounds. In addition to behavior of each SOM pool, we discuss implications of changes in land management on processes by which SOM compounds undergo protection and release. The characteristics and responses to changes in land use or land management are described for the light fraction (LF) and particulate organic matter (POM). We defined the LF and POM not occluded within microaggregates (53\textendash 250 \textmu m sized aggregates as unprotected. Our conclusions are illustrated in a new conceptual SOM model that differs from most SOM models in that the model state variables are measurable SOM pools. We suggest that physicochemical characteristics inherent to soils define the maximum protective capacity of these pools, which limits increases in SOM (i.e. C sequestration) with increased organic residue inputs.},

  abstract = {Since the 1900s, the link between soil biotic activity, soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and stabilization, and soil aggregate dynamics has been recognized and intensively been studied. By 1950, many studies had, mostly qualitatively, investigated the influence of the five major factors (i.e. soil fauna, microorganisms, roots, inorganics and physical processes) on this link. After 1950, four theoretical mile-stones related to this subject were realized. The first one was when Emerson [Nature 183 (1959) 538] proposed a model of a soil crumb consisting of domains of oriented clay and quartz particles. Next, Edwards and Bremner [J. Soil Sci. 18 (1967) 64] formulated a theory in which the solid-phase reaction between clay minerals, polyvalent cations and SOM is the main process leading to microaggregate formation. Based on this concept, Tisdall and Oades [J. Soil Sci. 62 (1982) 141] coined the aggregate hierarchy concept describing a spatial scale dependence of mechanisms involved in micro- and macroaggregate formation. Oades [Plant Soil 76 (1984) 319] suggested a small, but very important, modification to the aggregate hierarchy concept by theorizing the formation of microaggregates within macroaggregates. Recent research on aggregate formation and SOM stabilization extensively corroborate this modification and use it as the base for furthering the understanding of SOM dynamics. The major outcomes of adopting this modification are: (1) microaggregates, rather than macroaggregates protect SOM in the long term; and (2) macroaggregate turnover is a crucial process influencing the stabilization of SOM. Reviewing the progress made over the last 50 years in this area of research reveals that still very few studies are quantitative and/or consider interactive effects between the five factors. The quantification of these relationships is clearly needed to improve our ability to predict changes in soil ecosystems due to management and global change. This quantification can greatly benefit from viewing aggregates as dynamic rather than static entities and relating aggregate measurements with 2D and 3D quantitative spatial information. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This paper reviews the current knowledge of microbial processes affecting C sequestration in agroecosystems. The microbial contribution to soil C storage is directly related to microbial community dynamics and the balance between formation and degradation of microbial byproducts. Soil microbes also indirectly influence C cycling by improving soil aggregation, which physically protects soil organic matter (SOM). Consequently, the microbial contribution to C sequestration is governed by the interactions between the amount of microbial biomass, microbial community structure, microbial byproducts, and soil properties such as texture, clay mineralogy, pore-size distribution, and aggregate dynamics. The capacity of a soil to protect microbial biomass and microbially derived organic matter (MOM) is directly and/or indirectly (i.e., through physical protection by aggregates) related to the reactive properties of clays. However, the stabilization of MOM in the soil is also related to the efficiency with which microorganisms utilize substrate C and the chemical nature of the byproducts they produce. Crop rotations, reduced or no-tillage practices, organic farming, and cover crops increase total microbial biomass and shift the community structure toward a more fungal-dominated community, thereby enhancing the accumulation of MOM. A quantitative and qualitative improvement of SOM is generally observed in agroecosystems favoring a fungal-dominated community, but the mechanisms leading to this improvement are not completely understood. Gaps within our knowledge on MOM-C dynamics and how they are related to soil properties and agricultural practices are identified. \textcopyright{} Soil Science Society of America.},

  abstract = {Wetting dry soil triggers a pulse of microbial respiration. Respiration pulses after wetting can be complex, evolving through several stages before subsiding\textemdash possibly reflecting contributions from multiple carbon (C) sources. We hypothesized that respiration after wetting combines C from cellular sources (notably trehalose, a cellular osmo-protectant) and soluble extracellular C made available by the physical effects of wetting, with cellular sources contributing early during the pulse and extracellular C dominating later. We tested this hy\- pothesis by making measurements of soil respiration, microbial biomass, trehalose, and water extractable organic C after wetting dry soil in the laboratory. We then devised several alternative minimal models to evaluate the potential contributions of trehalose and extracellular C to the respiration pulse. We found that the chloroformlabile fraction of the microbial biomass was comprised of 50\% trehalose in dry soil. Both trehalose and water extractable organic C pools declined rapidly after wetting; trehalose disappeared within 3 h of water addition. Chloroform-labile glucose increased 3 h after water addition and then declined, suggesting rapid hydrolysis of trehalose and consumption of the resulting glucose. Respiration dynamics after wetting could be best explained by models that included two C sources, combining rapid metabolism of trehalose with slower consumption of extracellular soluble C. These results suggest that pulses of respiration after wetting reflect both osmolyte con\- sumption within the microbial biomass and enhanced extracellular C availability; hence, models of microbial drought response must account for both processes to fully resolve soil C dynamics.},

  abstract = {Microbial decomposers are responsible for the breakdown of organic matter (OM) and thus regulate soil carbon (C) stocks. During the decomposition of OM, microorganisms can use the assimilated C for biomass production or respire it as CO2, and the fraction of growth to total assimilation defines the microbial carbon-use efficiency (CUE). As such, CUE has direct consequences for how microbial decomposers affect the balance of C between atmosphere and soil. We estimated fungal and bacterial growth in C units in microcosm systems with submerged plant litter. We established conversion factors between bacterial and fungal growth to biomass and applied this to a dataset representing 9 different sites in temperate forest soils, temperate agricultural soils, and subarctic forest soils, to estimate growth rates of fungi and bacteria in units of C, to estimate the dominance of the two decomposer groups, and to compare these values to respiration to estimate the microbial CUE. We observed that fungal-to-bacterial growth ratios (F:B) ranged from 0.02 to 0.44, and that the fungal dominance was higher in soils with lower C:N ratio and higher C-quality. We found a negative exponential relationship between the dominance of fungi and the microbial CUE. CUE ranged from 0.03 to 0.30, and values clustered most strongly according to site rather than level of soil N. CUE was higher in soil with high C:N ratio and high C-quality. However, within each land-use type, a high mineral N-content did result in lower F:B and higher resulting CUE. In conclusion, a higher soil C-quality coincided with lower F:B and higher CUE across the surveyed sites, while a higher N availability did not. A higher N availability resulted in higher CUE and lower F:B within each site suggesting that site-specific differences such as the effect of plant community via e.g. plant litter and rhizosphere input, overrode the influence of N-availability.},

Recent theory suggests that living root inputs exert a disproportionate influence on SOC formation, but few field studies have explicitly tested this by separately tracking living root vs litter inputs as they move through the soil food web and into distinct SOC pools. We used a manipulative field experiment with an annual C4 grass in a forest understory to differentially track its living root vs litter inputs into the soil and to assess net SOC formation over multiple years. We show that living root inputs are 2\textendash 13 times more efficient than litter inputs in forming both slow-cycling, mineral-associated SOC as well as fast-cycling, particulate organic C. Furthermore, we demonstrate that living root inputs are more efficiently anabolized by the soil microbial community en route to the mineral-associated SOC pool (dubbed `the in vivo microbial turnover pathway'). Overall, our findings provide support for the primacy of living root inputs in forming SOC. However, we also highlight the possibility of nonadditive effects of living root and litter inputs, which may deplete SOC pools despite greater SOC formation rates.},

  abstract = {To predict the behavior of the terrestrial carbon cycle, it is critical to understand the source, formation pathway, and chemical composition of soil organic matter (SOM). There is emerging consensus that slow-cycling SOM generally consists of relatively low molecular weight organic carbon substrates that enter the mineral soil as dissolved organic matter and associate with mineral surfaces (referred to as ``mineral-associated OM,'' or MAOM). However, much debate and contradictory evidence persist around: (a) whether the organic C substrates within the MAOM pool primarily originate from aboveground vs. belowground plant sources and (b) whether C substrates directly sorb to mineral surfaces or undergo microbial transformation prior to their incorporation into MAOM. Here, we attempt to reconcile disparate views on the formation of MAOM by proposing a spatially explicit set of processes that link plant C source with MAOM formation pathway. Specifically, because belowground vs. aboveground sources of plant C enter spatially distinct regions of the mineral soil, we propose that fine-scale differences in microbial abundance should determine the probability of substrate\textendash microbe vs. substrate\textendash mineral interaction. Thus, formation of MAOM in areas of high microbial density (e.g., the rhizosphere and other microbial hotspots) should primarily occur through an in vivo microbial turnover pathway and favor C substrates that are first biosynthesized with high microbial carbon-use efficiency prior to incorporation in the MAOM pool. In contrast, in areas of low microbial density (e.g., certain regions of the bulk soil), MAOM formation should primarily occur through the direct sorption of intact or partially oxidized plant compounds to uncolonized mineral surfaces, minimizing the importance of carbon-use efficiency, and favoring C substrates with strong ``sorptive affinity.'' Through this framework, we thus describe how the primacy of biotic vs. abiotic controls on MAOM dynamics is not mutually exclusive, but rather spatially dictated. Such an understanding may be integral to more accurately modeling soil organic matter dynamics across different spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Soil fauna have been found to accelerate litter decomposition rates across many ecosystems, but little is known about their impact on soil organic matter formation during decomposition and their influence on ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling during this process. In a three-year litterbag-free decomposition study, we suppressed microarthropod abundance by 38\% and tracked the fate of 13C- and 15N-labeled litter into different soil organic matter fractions and the microbial community. Microarthropod suppression slowed litter mass loss and decreased litter carbon input into the soil and soil microbes during the first 18 months of decomposition. The microarthropod suppression did not alter the total amount of carbon and nitrogen incorporated in the soil after complete surface litter mass loss. However, lower early-stage microbial carbon uptake due to lower early-stage litter inputs to the soil, as well as a significant decrease in the C:N ratio of litter-derived organic matter inputs to the mineral soil fractions, made less nitrogen available for plant uptake in the microarthropod suppression treatment. Thus, the acceleration of early-stage, more labile litter inputs to the soil altered the timing and availability of carbon and nitrogen inputs to the soil. A simulation of these effects on the tallgrass prairie ecosystem using the DayCent model predicts lower net primary productivity and lower total soil C and N mineralization when soil microarthropods are less abundant. Our results highlight the importance of soil microarthropods for ecosystem functioning through their role in transforming decomposing litter organic matter into soil organic matter and the feedback of this process to ecosystem productivity and soil C sequestration.},

The atmospheric enrichment with CO2 and other GHGs has resulted in multiple negative consequences: such as the increase in the average temperature and the rise of the sea level. Hence, there is a growing interest in developing feasible methods to reduce the atmospheric levels of these gases. One of these strategies is to enhance C sequestration through the increase of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by the amendment of agricultural soils with sewage sludge. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the effects (positive or negative) of sewage sludge applications on the SOC pool. Thus, a simple approach developed under laboratory conditions is presented to discern the effect of a single sewage sludge application of 50 t ha-1 on the short-term SOC pool in 60 contrasting agricultural soils. The role of soil factors in the C sequestration of the recently added carbon was also studied. The application of sewage sludge supposed a mean increase of 1.7+or-1.6 g SOC kg-1, with peak increases of up to 3.8 g SOC kg-1 and decreases of up to 4.6 g SOC kg-1. The initial SOC contents conditioned the C sequestration after sewage sludge application, and no other soil property was related.},

Carbohydrates were more concentrated in the clay-size fraction of the forested than in that of the cultivated soils. Cultivation reduced aggregate stability, increased the proportions of the smaller size aggregates and their associated carbohydrates relative to the forested soils. The susceptibility of the cultivated soils to loss in structural stability reflected this initial aggregation which was greater in the more stable clayey than the fragile sandy soils. The aggregate stability of either the forested or the cultivated soil could not be accounted for by the levels of OC or total carbohydrates in the soil.},

The aliphatic bands in the 2920-2860 cm-1 regions were used to derive decomposition curves and mineralization rates of maize residues. Evaluation of soil organic matter changes by DRIFT in particle-size fractions depended on soil texture and soil aggregate stability. Decomposition could be followed over the full incubation period only in three size-fractions of the silty German soil because of its intermediate aggregate stability. DRIFT spectra were not useful in the least stable sandy Danish soil and in the most stable clayey Italian soil. Decomposition rates derived from DRIFT results were similar to those obtained by isotopic techniques. DRIFT spectroscopy may represent a rapid and accurate method to follow fresh organic matter degradation directly in soil matrix or particle-size fractions in some soils provided that adequate soil dispersion is obtained. ??2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {The ratio of carbon-to-nutrient in forest floors is usually much higher than the ratio of carbon-to-nutrient that soil microorganisms require for their nutrition. In order to understand how this mismatch affects carbon (C) cycling, we investigated the respiration rate per unit soil microbial biomass - the metabolic quotient (qCO2) - in relation to the soil carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) and carbon-to-phosphorus (C:P) ratio in temperate forests. For this purpose, cores of beech, spruce, and mixed spruce-beech forest soils were cut into slices of 1cm from the litter layer down to 5cm in the mineral soil, and the relationship between the qCO2 and the soil C:N and the soil C:P ratio was analyzed. We found that the qCO2 was positively correlated with soil C:N ratio in spruce soils (R=0.72), and with the soil C:P ratio in beech (R=0.93), spruce (R=0.80) and mixed forest soils (R=0.96). We also observed a close correlation between the qCO2 and the soil C concentration in all three forest types. Yet, the qCO2 decreased less with depth than the C concentration in all three forest types, suggesting that the change in qCO2 is not only controlled by the soil C concentration. We conclude that microorganisms increase their respiration rate per unit biomass with increasing soil C:P ratio and C concentration, which adjusts the substrate to their nutritional demands in terms of stoichiometry.},

We tested whether higher root exudate diversity enhances soil microbial biomass and diversity in a plant diversity gradient, thereby negating significant plant diversity effects on soil microbial properties. We set up plant monocultures and two- and three-species mixtures in microcosms using functionally dissimilar plants and soil of a grassland biodiversity experiment in Germany. Artificial exudate cocktails were added by combining the most common sugars, organic acids, and amino acids found in root exudates. We applied four different exudate cocktails: two exudate diversity levels (low- and high-diversity) and two nutrient-enriched levels (carbon- and nitrogen-enriched), and a control with water only. Soil microorganisms were more carbon- than nitrogen-limited. Cultivation-independent fingerprinting analysis revealed significantly different soil microbial communities among exudate diversity treatments. Most notably and according to our hypothesis, adding diverse exudate cocktails negated the significant plant diversity effect on soil microbial properties. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that root exudate diversity is a crucial link between plant diversity and soil microorganisms.},

  abstract = {Soil carbon (C) plays a central role in the global biogeochemical cycles of most major nutrients, but the degree to which the quality versus quantity of C controls microbial abundance and function across land uses is still somewhat uncertain. We measured soil organic matter (SOM) concentration and composition as well as nutrient ratios and other soil characteristics on two contrasting soil types across three land uses (forest, pasture, maize cropping), to determine their relationships to microbial abundance and specific measures of microbial activity (e.g. qCO2, the ratio of respiration rate to microbial biomass, and net laboratory N mineralization). Although there was significant variability in bulk SOM composition (by13C NMR spectroscopy), we could detect differences between broad-leaved forest and pasture/maize systems on a landscape scale, primarily attributable to differences in aryl C content. Variability in O-alkyl C between sites correlated strongly with the soil C:N ratio, but variability in alkyl C (which was particularly evident in pasture sites) could not be adequately explained by measured environmental or soil characteristics. Soil C:P and N:P ratios followed similar patterns with forest {$>$} pasture {$>$} maize. Bulk soil C:N, hot-water extractable C:N and particulate C:N all followed similar patterns with forest {$>$} pasture {$\approx$} maize cropping. Microbial biomass C:N followed a different pattern, however, with forest {$\approx$} pasture {$>$} maize. Despite the differences in SOM composition and nutrient ratios, anaerobically mineralizable N and hot-water extractable C (as a measures of available C) best explained the variation in microbial biomass and function across sites. Anaerobically mineralizable N generally explained the most variation for microbial biomass and qCO2and had the smallest soil or land use effect. Hot-water extractable C explained the most variance for net N mineralization. Addition of stoichiometric measures and other soil attributes (e.g. soil C:N, C:P, {$\delta$}15N) in a multiple regression model explained more of the variation than a single factor plus the land use effect (though soil order still explained a small, but significant amount of variance for measures of microbial biomass). A measure of available C, however, was needed to explain the maximum amount of variance in microbial biomass and function across sites (i.e. total C plus nutrient status and other soil attributes could not explain as much of the variance). Our data suggest that nutrient content/stoichiometry does assist in defining the quality of SOM, but a measure of available C (similar to the ``active'' pool in C models) is also needed. Anaerobically mineralizable N and/or hot water\textendash water extractable C appear to be adequate measures of available C that relate to ``active'' C, but C functional groups (from13C NMR spectroscopy) were not particularly useful for this purpose.},

  abstract = {Although current assessments of agricultural management practices on soil organic C (SOC) dynamics are usually conducted without any explicit consideration of limits to soil C storage, it has been hypothesized that the SOC pool has an upper, or saturation limit with respect to C input levels at steady state. Agricultural management practices that increase C input levels over time produce a new equilibrium soil C content. However, multiple C input level treatments that produce no increase in SOC stocks at equilibrium show that soils have become saturated with respect to C inputs. SOC storage of added C input is a function of how far a soil is from saturation level (saturation deficit) as well as C input level. We tested experimentally if C saturation deficit and varying C input levels influenced soil C stabilization of added 13C in soils varying in SOC content and physiochemical characteristics. We incubated for 2.5 years soil samples from seven agricultural sites that were closer to (i.e., A-horizon) or further from (i.e., C-horizon) their C saturation limit. At the initiation of the incubations, samples received low or high C input levels of 13C-labeled wheat straw. We also tested the effect of Ca addition and residue quality on a subset of these soils. We hypothesized that the proportion of C stabilized would be greater in samples with larger C saturation deficits (i.e., the C- versus A-horizon samples) and that the relative stabilization efficiency (i.e., ??SOC/??C input) would decrease as C input level increased. We found that C saturation deficit influenced the stabilization of added residue at six out of the seven sites and C addition level affected the stabilization of added residue in four sites, corroborating both hypotheses. Increasing Ca availability or decreasing residue quality had no effect on the stabilization of added residue. The amount of new C stabilized was significantly related to C saturation deficit, supporting the hypothesis that C saturation influenced C stabilization at all our sites. Our results suggest that soils with low C contents and degraded lands may have the greatest potential and efficiency to store added C because they are further from their saturation level. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The soil C saturation concept suggests a limit to whole soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation determined by inherent physicochemical characteristics of four soil C pools: unprotected, physically protected, chemically protected, and biochemically protected. Previous attempts to quantify soil C sequestration capacity have focused primarily on silt and clay protection and largely ignored the effects of soil structural protection and biochemical protection. We assessed two contrasting models of SOC accumulation, one with no saturation limit (i.e., linear first-order model) and one with an explicit soil C saturation limit (i.e., C saturation model). We isolated soil fractions corresponding to the C pools (i.e., free particulate organic matter [POM], microaggregate-associated C, silt- and clay-associated C, and nonhydrolyzable C) from eight long-term agroecosystem experiments across the United States and Canada. Due to the composite nature of the physically protected C pool, we fractioned it into mineral- vs. POM-associated C. Within each site, the number of fractions fitting the C saturation model was directly related to maximum SOC content, suggesting that a broad range in SOC content is necessary to evaluate fraction C saturation. The two sites with the greatest SOC range showed C saturation behavior in the chemically, biochemically, and some mineral-associated fractions of the physically protected pool. The unprotected pool and the aggregate-protected POM showed linear, nonsaturating behavior. Evidence of C saturation of chemically and biochemically protected SOC pools was observed at sites far from their theoretical C saturation level, while saturation of aggregate-protected fractions occurred in soils closer to their C saturation level.},

Small changes in the soil organic carbon stock could result in significant impacts on the atmospheric carbon concentration.

Scientists worldwide are contemplating questions such as: 'What is the average net change in soil organic carbon due to environmental conditions or management practices?', 'How can soil organic carbon sequestration be enhanced to achieve some mitigation of atmospheric carbon dioxide?' and 'Will this secure soil quality?'. These questions are far reaching, because maintaining and improving the world's soil resource is imperative to providing sufficient food and fibre to a growing population. Additional challenges are expected through climate change and its potential to increase food shortages.

Measurements of total DOC are often considered in relation to microbial activity levels but here we propose that quantification of DOC fractions is a more informative alternative. In a laboratory incubation, soil received DOC that was extracted from three organic matter sources: fresh compost, mature compost, and a mixture of the two. Soil microbial respiration (CO2 emission), and concentrations of hydrophobic (humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA) and neutrals (HoN)) and hydrophilic (Hi) DOC fractions were measured throughout the 35 d incubation. The A254 specific UV absorption of total and HA DOC were measured at the start and end of the incubation as an indicator of aromaticity. Microbial respiration rates were highest in soils amended with fresh compost DOC, which had a higher proportion of Hi compounds. Concentration of Hi was significantly and positively correlated with soil respiration, explaining 24\% more variation than total DOC. Humic acid concentrations significantly decreased over 35 d, including a 33\% reduction in HA from an unamended control soil. Compost treated soils' HA pools increased in aromaticity, suggesting preferential mineralization of the least aromatic HA molecules. A decrease in SUVA254 values in other HA pools may be the result of HA degradation in the absence of low-aromatic HA. Our observation of depletion of hydrophobic compounds from the HA fraction provides evidence that humic substances can be a relatively reactive pool, which can provide, together with hydrophilic compounds, a readily available C source to the microbial community.},

Given high species diversity in microbial communities and the ability of microbes to adapt rapidly to new conditions, this assumption of functional redundancy seems plausible. We test the assumption by comparing litter decomposition rates in experimental microcosms inoculated with distinct microbial communities. We find that rates of carbon dioxide production from litter decomposition were dependent upon the microbial inoculum, with differences in the microbial community alone accounting for substantial (20\%) variation in total carbon mineralized. Communities that shared a common history with a given foliar litter exhibited higher decomposition rates when compared to communities foreign to that habitat. Our results suggest that the implicit assumption in ecosystem models (i.e., microbial communities in the same environment are functionally equivalent) is incorrect. To predict accurately how biogeochemical processes will respond to global change may require consideration of the community composition and/or adaptation of microbial communities to past resource environments.},

We review a selection of the increasing body of literature on this subject and assess the relevance of its expectations by examining the methods used to determine, the impact of environmental factors on, and the expected ecosystem consequences of fungal:bacterial dominance. Considering methods, we observe that fungal:bacterial dominance is contingent on the actual measure used to estimate it. This has not been carefully considered; fungal:bacterial dominance of growth, biomass, and residue indicate different, and not directly relatable aspects, of the microbial community's influence on soil functioning. Considering relationships to environmental factors, we found that shifts in fungal:bacterial dominance were not always in line with the general expectation, in many instances even being opposite to them. This is likely because the traits expected to differentiate bacteria from fungi are often not distinct. Considering the impact of fungal:bacterial dominance on ecosystem function, we similarly found that expectations were not always upheld and this too could be due to trait overlap between these two groups.

  abstract = {Methyl bromide (MeBr; CH3Br) use for soil fumigation will be banned in 2005 due to its ozone depleting properties. Potential alternative chemicals to replace MeBr include chloropicrin (CP; CCl3NO2), 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D; C3H4Cl2), iodomethane (IM; CH3I), and propargyl bromide (PrBr; C3H3Br). The goal of this research was to assess changes in soil fungal populations, microbial biomass C (MBC) and respiration, nitrification potential, and enzyme activities after fumigation with MeBr and alternative fumigants. Four formulations of alternative fumigants (CP, InLine [61\% 1,3-D plus 33\% CP], Midas [50\% IM plus 50\% CP], and PrBr) were applied at commercial rates through drip irrigation systems to two field plots located in main strawberry production areas in California, USA. Soil samples (0\textendash 15 cm) were taken at 1, 4, and 30 or 37 wk after fumigant application. Fumigation with MeBr plus CP and the alternative chemicals eliminated soil-borne fungal pathogens in soil and reduced culturable fungal populations up to 4 wk post fumigation. Soil microbial respiration decreased with fumigant application and was the least ({$>$}40\% reduction relative to the control) in the PrBr treatment 1 wk after fumigation, while soil MBC was not affected by fumigation. The activities of acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase were generally lower in fumigated soils over the 30- or 37-wk study, and those of {$\beta$}-glucosidase and dehydrogenase were lower up to 4 wk past fumigation. Potential nitrification rates were substantially reduced ({$>$}55\% reduction relative to the control) by the fumigants, but rates recovered toward the end of this study. Results of this study suggested that fungal populations and the activities of acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase were more sensitive to fumigation with the tested MeBr and the alternative fumigants than total microbial biomass, microbial respiration, nitrification, and the activities of dehydrogenases and {$\beta$}-glucosidase. Short-term impacts of MeBr and its alternative fumigants on microbial activities and enzymatic processes suggest that all the tested fumigants have the potential to alter important microbial and enzymatic functions such as nutrient cycling.},

This study aimed to investigate the impact of these subsoil-specific gas conditions, which were measured in the field, on the decomposition of native soil organic C (SOC) and plant residues. Soil samples were taken on two neighbouring arable sites; one with high and the other with low SOC contents below 30~cm depth. An incubation experiment was carried out for 176~days, using gas conditions with reduced O2and increased CO2, matching gas conditions measured in subsoil. Three different gas concentrations were used in the experiment: Ambient, medium (17\% O2; 4\% CO2) and extreme (13\% O2; 8\% CO2). These gas treatments were applied to samples with and without the addition of C4 plant residues to the sampled soil. We determined the effects of these treatments on contents of SOC, microbial biomass C (MBC) and fungal ergosterol. Plant residue addition caused negative priming effects on SOC mineralisation in the subsoils. The contribution of plant-derived to total MBC was reduced under medium and extreme gas conditions (topsoil: 31\%; subsoil: 54\%). However, neither medium nor extreme gas conditions had general effects on MBC and microbial activity indices. There was no evidence that changes in the soil atmosphere are a major factor controlling C sequestration in subsoil. However, some results indicate that changes in soil atmospheric conditions do have an impact on microbial substrate use, which should be considered in C sequestration research in subsoil.},

Cellulose decomposition was 10 times faster in the fungi-dominated litter of Picea abies forest than in the bacteria-dominated soil. In the soil, the added 13C-labelled cellulose was the main source of microbial respiration and was preferentially accumulated in the fungal biomass and cellulose induced fungal proliferation. In contrast, in the litter, bacterial biomass showed higher labelling after 13C-cellulose addition and bacterial biomass increased. While 80\% of the total community was represented by 104-106 bacterial and 33-59 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 80\% of the cellulolytic communities of bacteria and fungi were only composed of 8-18 highly abundant OTUs. Both the total and 13C-labelled communities differed substantially between the litter and soil. Cellulolytic bacteria in the acidic topsoil included Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria, whereas these typically found in neutral soils were absent. Most fungal cellulose decomposers belonged to Ascomycota; cellulolytic Basidiomycota were mainly represented by the yeasts Trichosporon and Cryptococcus. Several bacteria and fungi demonstrated here to derive their carbon from cellulose were previously not recognized as cellulolytic. \textcopyright{} 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The treatments were zero tillage (ZT), minimum tillage (MT; cultivation to 7 cm), the conventional tillage (CT) practice of ploughing to 20 cm, and deep ploughing (DP) to 40 cm depth. In the 0-30 cm depth range, SOC content (corrected for bulk density differences between tillage treatments) was greatest under ZT and MT, but over 0-60 cm depth the SOC contents of these treatments were similar to the CT and DP treatments. DOC concentrations declined with increasing depth in ZT and MT above 20 cm, but there were no significant differences with depth in the CT and DP treatments. Beneath 20 cm, there was little change in DOC concentration with depth for all treatments, although for the MT treatment, there was less DOC beneath the depth of cultivation. The total microbial biomass decreased with increasing depth over the 0-60 cm range in the ZT and MT treatments, whereas it decreased with depth only below 30-40 cm in the CT and DP treatments. The microbial biomass was significantly different only between 0-5 cm in the ZT, CT and DP treatments, but not for other depths between all treatments. The bacterial biomass was greater in the ZT treatment than in MT, CT and DP near the soil surface, but not significantly different over the whole profile (0-60 cm).

  abstract = {The alternation of drying and rewetting events could dramatically affect the biological and structural properties of soil and consequently influence nutrient transformation. To examine whether organic amendments could improve the resistance and resilience of microbial function (extracellular enzyme activities), community composition (phospholipid fatty acids), and soil structure to drying-rewetting alternation, cropland soils with or without wheat-straw amendment were allowed to desiccate in a microcosm for two months, followed by moist incubation for five weeks, and continuously moist treatments were maintained at 50\% water holding capacity during the entire period, as a control treatment. Straw amendment increased microbial biomass, extracellular enzyme activities, the relative abundance of fungal groups, dissolved organic carbon, and proportion of large macroaggregates ({$>~$}2000~{$\mu$}m), but decreased mineral nitrogen and available phosphorus. The drying-rewetting treatment increased microbial biomass carbon and {$\beta$}-glucosidase activities by 10\% and 13\% in straw-amended soils, respectively, but not in unamended soils, and decreased the urease and alkaline phosphomonoesterase activities by {$>~$}15\% in unamended soils, but not in amended soils. The contents of fungi, actinomycetes, Pseudomonas spp., and Bacillus spp. decreased with drying, and more so with the subsequent rewetting, but recovered by the end of the experiment. The drying-rewetting treatment caused a decrease in the nitrate content in both soils ({$>~$}10\%) and an increase in the macroaggregates of straw-amended soils (\textasciitilde ~8\%). These results indicated that improved soil aggregation, as a result of straw amendment, protected microbial communities from drought stress and that nutrient acquisition promoted the post-rewetting colonization of heterotrophic communities characterized by hydrolase production, which consequently facilitated aggregate re-formation. Thus, straw amendment positively contributed to aggregate turnover and to both microbial and enzymatic responses to drying-rewetting events, which suggests that straw amendment is favorable to maintain soil function under conditions of increasing rainfall variability.},

The orchard soil properties have undergone significant alterations relative to that of AFS.

The pH, MWHC, available N, OC, HWEC, and enzyme activities in drip circle soil reduced significantly as compared to inter-row space soil. The activity of soil enzymes and MBC showed significant positive correlation with OC, HWEC and pH. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct variability in soil properties among AFS, drip circle and inter-row space soils, and the three clusters in the PCA plot differed significantly from each other (analysis of similarity, Global R = 0.92 at P{$<$} 0.01).

In the residue treatments, the addition of fungicide led to a significant suppression of fungal biomass and activity as well as a reduction of soil aggregate stability, which demonstrated the profound influence of fungal activity on aggregate formation. The addition of bactericide also significantly reduced soil aggregate stability, indicating that bacterial activity also played an important role in the macroaggregate formation. However, the effect of microbial extracellular polysaccharides on soil aggregate stability was not significant, which might be attributable to the fast wet sieving method used for aggregate separation.

However, the impact of land management intensity on soil microbial diversity (i.e. richness and evenness) and consequences for functioning is still poorly understood. Here, we addressed this question by coupling molecular characterization of microbial diversity with measurements of carbon (C) mineralization in soils obtained from three locations across Europe, each representing a gradient of land management intensity under different soil and environmental conditions. Bacterial and fungal diversity were characterized by high throughput sequencing of ribosomal genes. Carbon cycling activities (i.e., mineralization of autochthonous soil organic matter, mineralization of allochthonous plant residues) were measured by quantifying 12C- and 13C-CO2 release after soils had been amended, or not, with 13C-labelled wheat residues. Variation partitioning analysis was used to rank biological and physicochemical soil parameters according to their relative contribution to these activities. Across all three locations, microbial diversity was greatest at intermediate levels of land use intensity, indicating that optimal management of soil microbial diversity might not be achieved under the least intensive agriculture. Microbial richness was the best predictor of the C-cycling activities, with bacterial and fungal richness explaining 32.2 and 17\% of the intensity of autochthonous soil organic matter mineralization; and fungal richness explaining 77\% of the intensity of wheat residues mineralization. Altogether, our results provide evidence that there is scope for improvement in soil management to enhance microbial biodiversity and optimize C transformations mediated by microbial communities in soil.},

In our study, we incubated sieved soil samples without and with two labelled plant litters with different 13C signals for 199 days. The incubations were performed with two diurnal temperature treatments (5-15 \textdegree C, 15-25 \textdegree C) in a flow-through soil incubation system. Soil CO2 production was continuously monitored with an infrared gas analyser, while the 13C signal was determined from gas samples. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were used to quantify microbial biomass. We observed that the instantaneous temperature sensitivity initially did not differ between the original and the amended soil. However in the amended treatment the temperature sensitivity slightly but significantly increased during the incubation time, as did the PLFA amount from microbial biomass. Further, we found that addition of fresh plant material increased the rate of decomposition of the original soil organic matter. On a relative basis, this stimulation was similar in the warm and cold treatments (46\% and 52\%, respectively). Overall our study contrasts the view of a simple physico-chemically derived substrate-temperature sensitivity relationship of decomposition. Our results rather request an explicit consideration of microbial processes such as growth and priming effects. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Soil communities dominated by fungi such as those of no-tillage (NT) agroecosystems are often associated with greater soil organic matter (SOM) storage. This has been attributed in part to fungi having a higher growth yield efficiency (GYE) compared to bacteria. That is, for each unit of substrate C utilized, fungi invest a greater proportion into biomass and metabolite production than do bacteria. The assumption of higher fungal efficiency may be unfounded because results from studies in which fungal and bacterial efficiencies have been characterized are equivocal and because few studies have measured microbial GYE directly. In this study, we measured microbial GYE in agricultural soils by following 13C-labeled glucose loss, total CO2-C, and 13CO2-C evolution at 2 h intervals for 20 h in two experiments (differing in N amendment levels) in which the fungal:bacterial biomass ratios (F:B) were manipulated. No differences in efficiency were observed for communities with high versus low F:B in soils with or without added inorganic N. When calculated using 13CO 2-C (in contrast to total CO2-C) evolution, growth yield efficiencies of soils having high and low F:B were 0.69{$\pm$}0.01 and 0.70{$\pm$}0.01, respectively. When soils were amended with N, soils with high and low F:B had growth yield efficiencies of 0.78{$\pm$}0.01 and 0.76{$\pm$}0.01, respectively. Our experiments do not support the widely held assumption that soil fungi have greater growth efficiency than soil bacteria. Thus, claims of greater fungal efficiency may be unsubstantiated and should be evoked cautiously when explaining the mechanisms underlying greater C storage and slower C turnover in fungal-dominated soils. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking advantage of the difference in stable carbon isotopic composition provided by C-3 and C-4 plants, we partitioned soil respiration into R (om) and R (roots) for two soils with contrasting clay mineralogy, pH and carbon content over a 24 A degrees C temperature range (from 12 to 36 A degrees C). The Chromosol (dominated by illite, with near neutral pH and low organic carbon content) showed an increase in the proportion of R (om) with temperature, indicating an increase in the decomposition of soil organic carbon. In contrast, the Ferrosol (dominated by hematite and goethite, with acidic pH and high organic carbon) showed no change in the proportion of R (om) with warming, and a negative priming effect at the highest temperature. The observed positive priming effect for the Chromosol and a negative priming effect for the Ferrosol are consistent with contrasting mineralogy, reflecting the relatively weaker bond strength between soil carbon and illites in the Chromosol compared to the Ferrosol.},

  abstract = {Soil enzyme-catalyzed depolymerization of organic matter results in the production of low molecular weight and dissolved organic compounds. This fraction of soil organic matter is the immediate energy, carbon and other nutrient substrates for microbial catabolic pathways and thus likely plays an important role in soil processes. The purpose of this study was to elucidate interrelationships among dissolved organic matter, soil enzyme activity, and soil C and N mineralization from diverse agroecosystems. These systems included a conventional cropping, organic cropping, integrated crop\textendash livestock, plantation forestry, and succession from an abandoned agricultural field. We collected surface soil samples from 0 to 10 cm depth in early spring 2009 and examined the concentrations of soil-derived dissolved organic C and N, soluble phenolics, reducing sugars, and amino acids, the activities of NL-glucosidase, exoglucanase, phenol oxidase, peroxidase, and NL-glucosaminidase, and the rates of soil C and N mineralization. The integrated crop\textendash livestock system showed the highest concentrations of dissolved soil organic C (78 ␮g C g-1 soil) as well as phenolic compounds (1.5 ␮g C g-1 soil), reducing sugars (23 ␮g C g-1 soil), and amino acids (0.76 ␮g N g-1 soil), and these components were up to 3-fold greater than soils under the other systems. However, soil NL-glucosidase activity in the integrated crop\textendash livestock system was significantly lower than the other systems and appeared to reflect the inhibitory role of soluble phenolics on this enzyme; this enzymatic disparity was also revealed in our preliminary study conducted in 2008. Among the five enzyme activities examined, only peroxidase activity was correlated significantly with the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter as well as soil C and N mineralization. Soil peroxidase activity was negatively related to the relative abundance of reducing sugars (i.e., reducing sugar C as a fraction of dissolved organic C, r = -0.92, P {$<$} 0.05) and positively with soil C and N mineralization (r = 0.86, P {$<$} 0.1 for C mineralization; r = 0.85, P {$<$} 0.1 for N mineralization). Furthermore, relative abundance of reducing sugars was negatively associated with soil C mineralization (r = -0.80, P {$<$} 0.1) and so was relative abundance of amino acids with soil N mineralization (r = -0.97, P {$<$} 0.01). Our results suggested that diverse agroecosystems differed in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter and the differences could be correlated with soil peroxidase activity and soil C and N mineralization.},

  abstract = {Good soil structure for crop growth depends on the presence of aggregates of soil particles 1 to 10mm diameter which remain stable when wetted. When an unstable air dried aggregate is wetted rapidly it slakes into smaller sub-units which may also be aggregates. Slaking is common and occurs in a wide range of soils where the aggregates are not strong enough to withstand the pressures of entrapped air in capillaries or the pressures due to the swelling. In the field, slaking of aggregates occurs mainly in surface layers since those below the surface are protected from air-drying and from rapid wetting. Severe slaking with little layers limit infiltration of water and emergence of seedlings. Blackwell scientific publications Aggregate Stability What it is: Soil aggregates are groups of soil particles that bind to each other more strongly than to adjacent particles. Aggregate stability refers to the ability of soil aggregates to resist disintegration when disruptive forces associated with tillage and water or wind erosion are applied. Wet aggregate stability suggests how well a soil can resist raindrop impact and water erosion, while size distribution of dry aggregates can be used to predict resistance to abrasion and wind erosion. Why it is important: Changes in aggregate stability may serve as early indicators of recovery or degradation of soils. Aggregate stability is an indicator of organic matter content, biological activity, and nutrient cycling in soil. Generally, the particles in small aggregates ({$<$} 0.25 mm) are bound by older and more stable forms of organic matter. Microbial decomposition of fresh organic matter releases products (that are less stable) that bind small aggregates into large aggregates ({$>$} 2-5 mm). These large aggregates are more sensitive to management effects on organic matter, serving as a better indicator of changes in soil quality. Greater amounts of stable aggregates suggest better soil quality. When the proportion of large to small aggregates increases, soil quality generally increases. Stable aggregates can also provide a large range in pore space, including small pores within and large pores between aggregates. Pore space is essential for air and water entry into soil, and for air, water, nutrient, and biota movement within soil. Large pores associated with large, stable aggregates favor high infiltration rates and appropriate aeration for plant growth. Pore space also provides zones of weakness for root growth and penetration. Surface crusts and filled pores occur in weakly aggregated soils. Surface crusts prevent infiltration and promote erosion; filled pores lower water-holding and air-exchange capacity and increase bulk density, diminishing the conditions for root growth. Specific problems that might be caused by poor function: Aggregate stability is critical for infiltration, root growth, and resistance to water and wind erosion. Unstable aggregates disintegrate during rainstorms. Dispersed soil particles fill surface pores and a hard physical crust can develop when},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a small but reactive pool of the soil organic matter (SOM) that contributes to soil dynamics including the intermediary pool spanning labile to resistant SOM fractions. The solubilization of SOM (DOM production) is commonly attributed to both microbially driven and physico-chemically mediated processes, yet the extent to which these processes control DOM production is highly debated. We conducted a series of experiments using 13C-ryegrass residue or its extract (13C-ryegrass-DOM) separately under sterile and non-sterile conditions to demonstrate the importance of DOM production from microbial and physico-chemical processes. Soils with similar properties but differing in parent material were used to test the influence of mineralogy on DOM production. To test the role of the source of C for DOM production, one set of soils was leached frequently with 13C-ryegrass-DOM and in the other set of soils 13C-ryegrass residue was incorporated at the beginning of the experiment into the soil and soils were leached frequently with 0.01 mol L\`A1 CaCl2 solution. Leaching events for both treatments occurred at 12-d intervals over a 90-day period. The amount of dissolved organic C and N (DOC and DON) leached from residue-amended soils were consistently more than 3 times higher in sterile than non-sterile soils, decreasing with the time. Despite changes in the concentration of DOC and DON and the production of CO2, the proportion of DOC derived from the 13C-ryegrass residue was largely constant during the experiment (regardless of microbial activity), with the majority (about 70\%) of the DOM originating from native SOM. In 13C-residue-DOM treatments, after successive leaching events and regardless of the sterility conditions i) the native SOM consistently supplied at least 10\% of the total leached DOM, and ii) the contribution of native SOM to DOM was 2e2.9 times greater in 13C-residue-DOM amended soils than control soils, suggesting the role of desorption and exchange reactions in DOM production in presence of fresh DOM input. The contribution of the native SOM to DOM resulted in higher aromaticity and humification index. Our results suggest that physico-chemical processes (e.g. exchange or dissolution reactions) can primarily control DOM production. However, microbial activity affects SOM solubilization indirectly through DOM turnover.},

We have evaluated the effect of natural and modelled root-released materials on soil aggregates and the biodegradation of carbon from roots in the soil.

For all treatments, soil was amended with 2 g C kg(-1) soil and incubated for 30 days at 25 degreesC. The biodegradation of mucilage was similar to that of polygalacturonic acid, and slower than the decomposition of modelled exudates and glucose. Addition of all substrates increased the stability of aggregates, but the duration of this effect depended on the chemical nature of the material. Compared with the control, the proportion of stable aggregates after 30 days of incubation was multiplied by 3.8 for root mucilage, by 4.2 for modelled soluble exudates, by 2.5 for polygalacturonic acid and by 2.0 for glucose. The different fractions of root exudates in the rhizosphere evidently affected the aggregate stability.},

  abstract = {Agricultural intensification is placing tremendous pressure on the soil's capacity to maintain its functions leading to large-scale ecosystem degradation and loss of productivity in the long term. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find early indicators of soil health degradation in response to agricultural management. In recent years, major advances in soil meta-genomic and spatial studies on microbial communities and community-level molecular characteristics can now be exploited as 'biomarker' indicators of ecosystem processes for monitoring and managing sustainable soil health under global change. However, a continental scale, cross biome approach assessing soil microbial communities and their functional potential to identify the unifying principles governing the susceptibility of soil biodiversity to land conversion is lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis from a dataset generated from 102 peer-reviewed publications as well as unpublished data to explore how properties directly linked to soil nutritional health (total C and N; C:N ratio), primary productivity (NPP) and microbial diversity and composition (relative abundance of major bacterial phyla determined by next generation sequencing techniques) are affected in response to agricultural management across the main biomes of Earth (arid, continental, temperate and tropical). In our analysis, we found strong statistical trends in the relative abundance of several bacterial phyla in agricultural (e.g., Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi) and natural (Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria) systems across all regions and these trends correlated well with many soil properties. However, main effects of agriculture on soil properties and productivity were biome-dependent. Our meta-analysis provides evidence on the predictable nature of the microbial community responses to vegetation type. This knowledge can be exploited in future for developing a new set of indicators for primary productivity and soil health.},

Ecosystem health has been defined in terms of ecosystem stability and resilience in response to a disturbance or stress. We therefore, suggest that indicators for soil health could be found by monitoring responses of the soil microbial community to the application of different stress factors at various intensities. The amplitude of a response and time to return to the current state before application of stress could serve as measures of soil health. Root pathogens are an integral part of soil microbial communities, and the occurrence of epiphytotics forms an indication of an ecosystem in distress. Disease suppression can be viewed as a manifestation of ecosystem stability and health. Thus, indicators for soil health could possibly also function as indicators for disease suppressiveness. Previously suggested indicators for soil health and disease suppression have mainly been lists of variables that were correlated to more or less disturbed soils (ranging from conventional to organic agricultural soils, grassland and forest soils) or to conduciveness to disease. We suggest a systematic ecological approach to the search for indicators for soil health and disease suppression, namely, measuring biological responses to various stress factors and the time needed to return to the current state.},

There was a close relationship between microbial biomass C, measured by fumigation-incubation (from the relationship Biomass C = FC/0.45) and EC given by the equation: Biomass C = (2.64 {$\pm$} 0.060) EC that accounted for 99.2\% of the variance in the data.

Soil Sci. 83: 363\textendash 380. To fulfill commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, Canada is required to provide verifiable estimates and uncertainties for soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, and for changes in those stocks over time. Estimates and uncertainties for agricultural soils can be derived from long-term studies that have measured differences in SOC between different management practices. We compiled published data from long-term studies in Canada to assess the effect of agricultural management on SOC. A total of 62 studies were compiled, in which the difference in SOC was determined for conversion from native land to cropland, and for different tillage, crop rotation and fertilizer management practices. There was a loss of 24 {$\pm$} 6\% of the SOC after native land was converted to agricultural land. No-till (NT) increased the storage of SOC in western Canada by 2.9 {$\pm$} 1.3 Mg ha\textendash 1; however, in eastern Canada conversion to NT did not increase SOC. In general, the potential to store SOC when NT was adopted decreased with increasing background levels of SOC. Using no-tillage, reducing summer fallow, including hay in rotation with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), plowing green manures into the soil, and applying N and organic fertilizers were the practices that tended to show the most consistent increases in SOC storage. By relating treatment SOC levels to those in the control treatments, SOC stock change factors and their levels of uncertainty were derived for use in empirical models, such as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines model for C stock changes. However, we must be careful when attempting to extrapolate research plot data to farmers' fields since the history of soil and crop management has a significant influence on existing and future SOC stocks.},

As microbes affect soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics largely through their activity, their impact may not be deduced from biomass measurements alone. Moreover, residual microbial tissue is thought to facilitate SOM stabilization, and to provide a long term integrated measure of effects on the microorganisms. In this study, we therefore compared the effect of reduced (RT) and conventional tillage (CT) on the biomass, growth rate and residues of the major microbial decomposer groups fungi and bacteria. Soil samples were collected at two depths (0-5~cm and 5-20~cm) from plots in an Irish winter wheat field that were exposed to either conventional or shallow non-inversion tillage for 7 growing seasons. Total soil fungal and bacterial biomasses were estimated using epifluorescence microscopy. To separate between biomass of saprophytic fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizae, samples were analyzed for ergosterol and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers. Growth rates of saprophytic fungi were determined by [14C]acetate-in-ergosterol incorporation, whereas bacterial growth rates were determined by the incorporation of 3H-leucine in bacterial proteins. Finally, soil contents of fungal and bacterial residues were estimated by quantifying microbial derived amino sugars. Reduced tillage increased the total biomass of both bacteria and fungi in the 0-5~cm soil layer to a similar extent. Both ergosterol and PLFA analyses indicated that RT increased biomass of saprophytic fungi in the 0-5~cm soil layer. In contrast, RT increased the biomass of arbuscular mycorrhizae as well as its contribution to the total fungal biomass across the whole plough layer. Growth rates of both saprotrophic fungi and bacteria on the other hand were not affected by soil tillage, possibly indicating a decreased turnover rate of soil microbial biomass under RT. Moreover, RT did not affect the proportion of microbial residues that were derived from fungi. In summary, our results suggest that RT can promote soil C storage without increasing the role of saprophytic fungi in SOM dynamics relative to that of bacteria. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The majority of microbial mediated soil processes depend on availability of organic matter (OM), water and air. Because of its ability to visualize the 3D architecture of soil non-destructively, X-ray computed tomography (CT) is becoming a widespread tool for studying soil pore network structure. However, phase determination of pore space, soil OM, soil mineral matter (MM) and water is often limited even with the latest technological and software advances, allowing high resolution and better quality imaging. Contrast agents commonly used in histology enable enhancement of X-ray attenuation of targeted structures or compounds. Here we report on the first systematic investigation of the use of such X-ray contrast agents for soil research. An evaluation procedure as well as a method to apply the agents to soil samples was developed and applied on reference soil samples. The effectiveness and selectivity of the contrast agents was evaluated for soil organic matter (SOM), MM and water. Several products were found to selectively increase the attenuation of water or SOM. The four agents with the best OM-staining capabilities (phosphomolybdenic acid (PMA), silver nitrate, lead nitrate and lead acetate) were further tested on an OM-MM mixture and all showed an increased of the SOM attenuation coefficient above the MM values. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Rates of evolution of 14CO2, decline in residual organic 14C, and net immobilization and mineralization of N and 15N in the sandy loam soil were more rapid than in the clay soil. First order decay rates for the decomposition of residual 14C, after 10 days, were consistently twice as fast in the sandy loam soil. By contrast, the efficiency with which glucose was utilized within the first few days, and the amounts of C, 14C, N and 15N present as soil biomass throughout the incubation, were greater in the clay soil than in the sandy loam. Biomass 14C as a percentage of residual organic 14C, was consistently 1.5 times greater in the clay soil. Compared with soils held continuously moist, soils which were intermittently dried and remoistened contained smaller amounts of isotope-labelled biomass C and N, but overall similar amounts of total residual organic 14C and 15N. Remoistening of dried soils caused a temporary (4 days) flush in C and N mineralization rates. A simulation model describes C and N behaviour in the two soils. Three features of the model are proposed to expain short-term differences between soils in the rates of C and N turnover, viz. the clay soil (a) has a greater capacity to preserve biomass C and N (b) holds a higher proportion of microbial decay products in the near vicinity of surviving cells, and, to a lesser extent, (c) utilizes glucose and metabolic products more efficiently for biosynthetic reactions.},

  abstract = {Soil architecture is the dominant control over microbially mediated decomposition proces- ses in terrestrial ecosystems. Organic matter is physically protected in soil so that large amounts of well-decomposable compounds can be found in the vicinity of largely starving microbial popula- tions. Among the mechanisms proposed to explain the phenomena of physical protection in soil are adsorption of organics on inorganic clay surfaces and entrapment of materials in aggregates or in places inaccessible to microbes. Indirect evidence for the existence of physical protection in soil is provided by the occurrence of a burst of microbial activity and related increased decomposition rates following disruption of soil structures, either by natural processes such as the remoistening of a dried soil or by human activities such as ploughing. In contrast, soil compaction has only little effect on the transformation of '4C-glucose. Another mechanism of control by soil structure and texture on decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems is through their impact on microbial turnover processes. The microbial population is not only the main biological agent of decomposition in soil, it is also an important, albeit small, pool through which most of the organic matter in soil passes. Estimates on the relative importance of different mechanisms controlling decomposition in soil could be derived from results of combined tracer and modelling studies. However, suitable meth- odology to quantify the relation between soil structure and biological processes as a function of different types and conditions of soils is still lacking.},

Fields of application include enhancement of crop growth, protection of crops against plant-pathogenic organisms, stimulation of biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds (bioaugmentation), and improvement of soil structure. Inoculation of soils has already been applied for decades, but it has often yielded inconsistent or disappointing results. This is caused mainly by a commonly observed rapid decline in inoculant population activity following introduction into soil, i.e., a decline of the numbers of inoculant cells and/or a decline of the (average) activity per cell. In this review, we discuss the available information on the effects of key factors that determine the fate and activity of microorganisms introduced into soil, with emphasis on bacteria. The factors addressed include the physiological status of the inoculant cells, the biotic and abiotic interactions in soil, soil properties, and substrate availability. Finally, we address the possibilities available to effectively manipulate the fate and activity of introduced microorganisms in relation to the main areas of their application.},

  abstract = {We studied the biochemical and biophysical processes of carbon sequestration in an intensive agroforestry system on two soils (Feralsol - Luero; Arenosol - Teso) in W. Kenya to elucidate the mechanisms associated with long-term carbon storage. Specifically, we looked at a top-down model (macro-aggregates form around organic matter particles and micro-aggregates form within the macro-aggregates) and a bottom-up model (micro-aggregates form independently and are incorporated into macro-aggregates) of soil aggregate formation. Soil samples were collected from experiments on improved tree fallows using different species and two tillage treatments; water-stable aggregates were extracted and sorted into three size classes: macro-aggregates ({$>$}212{$\mu$}m), meso-aggregates (53-212{$\mu$}m) and micro-aggregates (20-53{$\mu$}m). Organic matter characterization of each fraction was based on 13C isotope abundance, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and the abundance of polysaccharides. Improved fallows increased soil C by 0.28 and 0.26kg m-2 in the top 20cm of the soil profile in Luero and Teso, respectively. Tillage altered the distribution of aggregates among size classes. Changes in the {$\delta$}13C signature in each fraction indicated that more of the new carbon was found in the macro-aggregates (35-70\%) and meso-aggregates (18-49\%) in Luero and less (9-17\%) was found in the micro-aggregates. In Teso, about 40-80\% of the new aggregate C was found in the meso-aggregates, 14-45\% was found in the micro-aggregates and only 4-26\% was found in the macro-aggregates. The meso-aggregates and macro-aggregates to a lesser extent, in both sites, were enriched in carboxylic-C and aromatic-C, indicating the importance of OM decomposition and plant-derived C in the stabilization of larger aggregates, supporting the top-down model of aggregate formation. Microbially derived polysaccharides play a leading role in the formation of stable micro-aggregates and carboxylic-C promotes stabilization through surface occlusion. This bottom-up process is essential to promote long-term carbon sequestration in soils. Additionally, the micro-aggregates at both sites were enriched in polysaccharides and had elevated ratios of galactose + mannose:arabinose + xylose than the other aggregate fractions, indicating the importance of microbial processes in the formation of stable micro-aggregates and supporting the bottom-up model. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Low-income producers and consumers of food will be more vulnerable to climate change owing to their comparatively limited ability to invest in adaptive institutions and technologies under increasing climatic risks.

The rhizosphere, the soil volume around living roots influenced by root activities, represents hotspots for organic carbon (OC) inputs, microbial activity, and carbon turnover. Rhizosphere processes remain poorly understood and the observation of key mechanisms for carbon transfer and protection in intact rhizosphere microenvironments are challenging. We deciphered the fate of photosynthesis-derived OC in intact wheat rhizosphere, combining stable isotope labeling at field scale with high-resolution 3D-imaging. We used nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry and focus ion beam-scanning electron microscopy to generate insights into rhizosphere processes at nanometer scale. In immature wheat roots, the carbon circulated through the apoplastic pathway, via cell walls, from the stele to the cortex. The carbon was transferred to substantial microbial communuties, mainly represented by bacteria surrounding peripheral root cells. Iron oxides formed bridges between roots and bigger mineral particles, such as quartz, and surrounded bacteria in microaggregates close to the root surface. Some microaggregates were also intimately associated with the fungal hyphae surface. Based on these results, we propose a conceptual model depicting the fate of carbon at biogeochemical interfaces in the rhizosphere, at the forefront of growing roots. We observed complex interplays between vectors (roots, fungi, bacteria), transferring plant-derived OC into root-free soil and stabilizing agents (iron oxides, root and microorganism products), potentially protecting plant-derived OC within microaggregates in the rhizosphere.},

Here, we present an interdisciplinary approach using artificial soils to study the establishment of the microbial community and the formation of macro-aggregates as a function of the mineral composition by using artificial soils. The defined composition of a model system enables to directly relate the development of microbial communities and soil structure to the presence of specific constituents. Five different artificial soil compositions were produced with two types of clay minerals (illite, montmorillonite), metal oxides (ferrihydrite, boehmite) and charcoal incubated with sterile manure and a microbial community derived from a natural soil. We used the artificial soils to analyse the response of these model soil systems to additional sterile manure supply (after 562 days). The artificial soils were subjected to a prolonged incubation period of more than two years (842 days) in order to take temporally dynamic processes into account. In our model systems with varying mineralogy, we expected a changing microbial community composition and an effect on macro-aggregation after OM addition, as the input of fresh substrate will re-activate the artificial soils. The abundance and structure of 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) fragments amplified from total community DNA were studied by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), respectively. The formation of macro-aggregates ({$>$}2mm), the total organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) contents, the OC and N contents in particle size fractions and the CO2 respiration were determined. The second manure input resulted in higher CO2 respiration rates, 16S rRNA gene and ITS copy numbers, indicating a stronger response of the microbial community in the matured soil-like system. The type of clay minerals was identified as the most important factor determining the composition of the bacterial communities established. The additional OM and longer incubation time led to a re-formation of macro-aggregates which was significantly higher when montmorillonite was present. Thus, the type of clay mineral was decisive for both microbial community composition as well as macro-aggregation, whereas the addition of other components had a minor effect. Even though different bacterial communities were established depending on the artificial soil composition, the amount and quality of the OM did not show significant differences supporting the concept of functional redundancy.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) consists of various functional pools that are stabilized by specific mechanisms and have certain turnover rates. For the development of mechanistic models that predict changes in SOM storage, these pools have to be quantified and characterized. In the past, numerous fractionation schemes have been developed to separate and analyse such SOM fractions. In this review, the SOM fractions obtained with such operational fractionation procedures are described in terms of their pool sizes, chemical properties, and turnover rates. The main objective of this review is to evaluate these operationally defined fractions with respect to their suitability to describe functional SOM pools that could be used to parameterize SOM turnover models. Fractionation procedures include (1) physical separation of SOM into aggregate, particle size, and density fractions and fractions according to their magnetic susceptibility, and (2) various wet chemical procedures that fractionate SOM according to solubility, hydrolysability, and resistance to oxidation or by destruction of the mineral phase. Furthermore, combinations of fractionation methods are evaluated. The active SOM pool with turnover rates {$<$}10 years may best be represented by the soil microbial biomass and the light fraction ({$<$}1.6-2 g cm-3) obtained by density fractionation (if black carbon contents are considered). Most chemical and physical fractionations as well as combinations of methods yield SOM fractions that are not homogeneous in terms of turnover rates. It has proven to be particularly difficult to isolate functional fractions that represent the passive model pools in which the majority of soil SOM is stabilized. The available fractionation methods do not correspond to specific stabilization mechanisms and hence do not describe functional SOM pools. Another problem is that comprehensive data for turnover rates and data for whole soil profiles are only now becoming available, especially for new fractionation methods. Such information as well as the use of specific markers and compound-specific isotope analysis may be important for future differentiation and evaluation of functional SOM fractions. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Biodiversity loss has become a global concern as evidence accumulates that it will negatively affect ecosystem services on which society depends. So far, most studies have focused on the ecological consequences of above-ground biodiversity loss; yet a large part of Earth's biodiversity is literally hidden below ground. Whether reductions of biodiversity in soil communities below ground have consequences for the overall performance of an ecosystem remains unresolved. It is important to investigate this in view of recent observations that soil biodiversity is declining and that soil communities are changing upon land use intensification. We established soil communities differing in composition and diversity and tested their impact on eight ecosystem functions in model grassland communities. We show that soil biodiversity loss and simplification of soil community composition impair multiple ecosystem functions, including plant diversity, decomposition, nutrient retention, and nutrient cycling. The average response of all measured ecosystem functions (ecosystem multifunctionality) exhibited a strong positive linear relationship to indicators of soil biodiversity, suggesting that soil community composition is a key factor in regulating ecosystem functioning. Our results indicate that changes in soil communities and the loss of soil biodiversity threaten ecosystem multifunctionality and sustainability.},

  abstract = {Mycorrhizal fungi constitute a considerable sink for carbon in most ecosystems. This carbon is used for building extensive mycelial networks in the soil as well as for metabolic activity related to nutrient uptake. A number of methods have been developed recently to quantify production, standing biomass and turnover of extramatrical mycorrhizal mycelia (EMM) in the field. These methods include minirhizotrons, in-growth mesh bags and cores, and indirect measurements of EMM based on classification of ectomycorrhizal fungi into exploration types. Here we review the state of the art of this methodology and discuss how it can be developed and applied most effectively in the field. Furthermore, we also discuss different ways to quantify fungal biomass based on biomarkers such as chitin, ergosterol and PLFAs, as well as molecular methods, such as qPCR. The evidence thus far indicates that mycorrhizal fungi are key components of microbial biomass in many ecosystems. We highlight the need to extend the application of current methods to focus on a greater range of habitats and mycorrhizal types enabling incorporation of mycorrhizal fungal biomass and turnover into biogeochemical cycling models. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The association between SOM and soil fertility remains a critical question in need of investigation. During the past century of inquiry, methods of SOM fractionation have proliferated greatly. Appro- priate matching of methods, soils, and questions can lead to rapid advances in understanding the biological, physical, and chemical contributions of SOM fractions. Fractions are measurable con- stituents of organic matter and not the theoretically defined pools of SOM represented in empirically based models. Thus, issues of identity and meaning must be dealt with before information about specific SOM fractions is effectively used to guide management or serve as model inputs. This challenge is complicated by the fact that the ability and desire to sort materials with decomposition rates that vary within months, years, decades, centuries or millennia will vary with the subject of inquiry and resolving power of the fraction. The SOM fractions used to estimate kinetically distinct pools can be divided into three functional classes, with the most dynamic SOM constituents being most closely identified with biological activity, young and intermediate-age materials being asso- ciated with physical activity, and materials with the longest half-life contributing most to chemical reactivity. This complexity, along with heterogeneity within SOM fractions, makes interpretation and application of information derived from SOM fractions difficult. This is particularly true for labile SOM fractions, which include components that are dynamic within a year yet have integrative properties that reflect average status of material accrued over several years to a decade. Labile fractions can themselves be subdivided into active or inactive components, and the divisions will likely vary according to whether the subject of interest is biological, physical, or chemical reactivity. Measures of POM are often used as direct estimates of the active C fraction even though this fraction can contain refractory structures, including charcoal; this is because POM kinetics are quite sensitive to resource quality and physical factors impacting decay. Compared to humic substances, POM is more diverse in its route of origin, chemical composition, and function. The composition of POM can effectively reflect the status of labile SOM, providing valuable information about substrate and habitat quality affecting N mineralization or immobilization dynamics N and other microbially regulated processes. Verification of the functional relevance of POM fractions isolated in the laboratory remains a challenge. At present, we know far more about the characteristics of POM isolated by a variety of techniques than we do about how to accurately and consistently interpret this information},

  abstract = {Variations in microbial biomass and activity within aggregate fractions can provide valuable information regarding mechanisms for enhancing carbon (C) sequestration and nutrient status in agricultural soils. The effects of different chronosequence phases on these variations in tea (Camellia sinensis L.) plantations have not yet been well documented. In this study, we assessed the relationship between tea plantation age and microbial biomass and activity at the aggregate scale. Microbial biomass C and respiration rate were determined in different size fractions from soil depths of 0???20 and 20???40 cm under four tea plantations of varying ages (16, 23, 31, and 53 years) in the hilly region of Western Sichuan, China. Aggregates were separated by an improved dry-sieving procedure into four fractions: {$>$} 2 mm (large macro-aggregates), 2???1 mm (medium macro-aggregates), 1???0.25 mm (small macro-aggregates), and {$<$} 0.25 mm (micro-aggregates). All the tea plantations we observed were dominated by large macro-aggregates with values of 41.25\%???61.12\% at both soil depths. Their proportion and mean weight diameter (MWD) were higher in 23-year tea plantation than those in other plantations, indicating that the soil structure in the 23-year tea plantation was more stable than the others. Notably, we found that aggregate stability is closely correlated with microbial biomass and their relationship is dependent on aggregate size. Aggregates with different particle sizes exhibited different levels of microbial biomass C and respiration rate regardless of tea plantation age. The soil properties we examined were at their highest levels in large macro-aggregates, implying that microorganisms associated with these fractions are more biologically active there than elsewhere in the present ecosystem. Decreases in soil microbial biomass and activity after 23 years of tea planting occurred mainly due to reduction in large macro-aggregates in the whole soil over time. To this effect, it is crucial to establish appropriate management protocol tailored to the prevention of soil structure degradation after 23 years of tea planting in such plantations.},

However, how soil aggregation regulates SOC sequestration and microbial activity after manuring has received less attention. We studied the distribution of SOC, microbial community composition and activity in four aggregate classes ({$>$}2, 1\textendash 2, 0.25\textendash 1, and {$<$}0.25~mm) using field moisture sieving of soil from a 23-year manure addition field experiment under a rice\textendash barley rotation.

Manuring increased SOC and total nitrogen contents of the large macroaggregates by 9.1\% and 7.1\%, respectively, but not of the microaggregates. Also, manuring increased the phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) contents of bacteria, fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and total microbes of the macroaggregates ({$>$}2, 1\textendash 2, and 0.25\textendash 1~mm) but not of the microaggregates. The fungal/bacterial PLFA ratio remained unchanged in all aggregates. Manuring increased {$\beta$}-glucosidase and chitinase activities in two macroaggregate classes ({$>$}2, and 1\textendash 2~mm), but not in the microaggregates. In conclusion, SOC, microbial biomasses and enzyme activities in the macroaggregates are more sensitive to manuring than in the microaggregates.

  abstract = {The microbial metabolic quotient (respiration-to-biomass ratio) or qCO2, conceptually based on Odum's theory of ecosystem succession, is increasingly being used as an index of ecosystem development (during which it supposedly declines) and disturbance (due to which it supposedly increases). We investigated the suitability of qCO2 as an bioindicator using: (1) data from the Franz Josef Glacier chronosequence, spanning over 22,000 years; and (2) data recalculated from published studies. In the Franz Josef sequence, a detectable decline in qCO2 occurred in the first 250 years in both the L-layer and mineral soil layer. However, in the later phases of the succession there was a sharp increase in qCO2 indicating reduced microbial efficiency, which appeared to be related to stress (independent of disturbance) resulting from steady-state conditions. Calculation of qCO2 from three previous studies on disturbance and ecosystem development indicated that this index responds unpredictably and does not necessarily decline during succession. Plant litter decomposition studies demonstrate that while qCO2 usually declines initially, a significant increase in qCO2 can eventually follow on litter types resistant to decomposition. Correlation analysis of each of 24 previous studies demonstrated that qCO2 often declines with increasing pH, clay content and amounts of microbial biomass; these three soil properties are all indicative of varying stress rather than disturbance levels. Reanalysis of data from 16 previous studies indicated that some disturbances such as fertilization and liming can either increase or decrease qCO2 values depending on whether the disturbance alleviates stress (reducing qCO2)or is more extreme than the stress it alleviates (enhancing qCO2). Although cultivation represents a severe disturbance, qCO2 is not predictably enhanced by this perturbation. While qCO2 undoubtedly provides a useful measure of microbial efficiency, our data suggests it has limitations because it can be insensitive to disturbance and ecosystem development, fails to distinguish between effects of disturbance and stress, and does not decline predictably in response to ecosystem development whenever stress increases along successional gradients. \textcopyright{} 1995.},

We used meta-analysis and an enzyme-driven biogeochemical model to explore the drivers and biogeochemical consequences of changes in the fungal-to-bacterial ratio (F : B). In our meta-analysis data set, F : B increased with soil C : N ratio (R(2) = 0.224, P {$<$} 0.001), a relationship predicted by our model. We found that differences in biomass turnover rates influenced F : B under conditions of C limitation, while differences in biomass stoichiometry set the upper bounds on F : B once a nutrient limitation threshold was reached. Ecological interactions between the two groups shifted along a gradient of resource stoichiometry. At intermediate substrate C : N, fungal N mineralisation fuelled bacterial growth, increasing total microbial biomass and decreasing net N mineralisation. Therefore, we conclude that differences in bacterial and fungal physiology may have large consequences for ecosystem-scale C and N cycling.},

  abstract = {This chapter discusses the structure and function of sterols in fungi. The distribution of sterols among fungi follows the taxonomic separation of fungi at the subdivision level. The Mastigomycotina, or lower fungi, produce mainly cholesterol and/or its C-24 alkyl and/or alkylidene derivatives, but no ergosterol. There is less distinction among fungi at the class level with respect to sterol composition among the Mastigomycotina. Fucosterol is a major sterol of many sterol-producing Oomycetes and may be accompanied by cholesterol and 24-methylene cholesterol. Cholesterol is produced by some but not all Chytridiomycetes, which, along with the Hypochytriomycetes, have 24-alkyl rather than 24-alkylidene derivatives as major sterols. It is well-known that the pythiaceous fungi (Oomycetes) do not produce sterols because they cannot carry out the epoxidation of squalene, and it is believed that Plasmodiophoromycetes, which are obligate parasites, also do not produce sterols. Sterols are synthesized by enzymes located mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum, but they do not tend to accumulate there or in endomembranes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum.},

  abstract = {Clay is generally considered an important stabiliser that reduces the rate of decomposition of organic matter (OM) in soils. However, several recent studies have shown trends contradicting this widely held view, emphasising our poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the clay effects on OM decomposition. Here, an incubation experiment was conducted using artificial soils differing in clay content (0, 5, and 50\%) at different temperatures (5, 15, and 25??C) to determine the effects of clay content, temperature and their interaction on fresh OM decomposition. CO2 efflux was measured throughout the experiment. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), enzyme activities, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were also measured at the end of the pre-incubation and incubation periods in order to follow changes in microbial community structure, functioning, and substrate availability. The results showed that higher clay contents promoted OM decomposition probably by increasing substrate availability and by sustaining a greater microbial biomass, albeit with a different community structure and with higher activities of most of the extracellular enzymes assayed. Higher clay content induced increases in the PLFA contents of all bacterial functional groups relative to fungal PLFA content. However, clay content did not change the temperature sensitivity (Q10) of OM decomposition. The higher substrate availability in the high clay artificial soils sustained more soil microbial biomass, resulting in a different community structure and different functioning. The higher microbial biomass, as well as the changed community structure and functions, accelerated OM decomposition. From these observations, an alternative pathway to understanding the effects of clay on OM decomposition is proposed, in which clay may not only accelerate the decomposition of organic materials in soils but also facilitate the SOM accumulation as microbial products in the long term. Our results highlight the importance of clay content as a control over OM decomposition and greater attention is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study was conducted to quantify potential soil C sequestration rates for different crops in response to decreasing tillage intensity or enhancing rotation complexity, and to estimate the duration of time over which sequestration may occur. Analyses of C sequestration rates were completed using a global database of 67 longterm agricultural experiments, consisting of 276 paired treatments. Results indicate, on average, that a change from conventional tillage (CT) to no-till (NT) can sequester 57 Ϯ 14 g C mϪ2 yrϪ1, excluding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow systems which may not result in SOC accumulation with a change from CT to NT. Enhancing rotation complexity can sequester an average 20 Ϯ 12 g C mϪ2 yrϪ1, excluding a change from continuous corn (Zea mays L.) to corn-soybean (Glycine max L.) which may not result in a significant accumulation of SOC. Carbon sequestration rates, with a change from CT to NT, can be expected to peak in 5 to 10 yr with SOC reaching a new equilibrium in 15 to 20 yr. Following initiation of an enhancement in rotation complexity, SOC may reach a new equilibrium in approximately 40 to 60 yr. Carbon sequestration rates, estimated for a number of individual crops and crop rotations in this study, can be used in spatial modeling analyses to more accurately predict regional, national, and global C sequestration potentials.},

We examined C and N dynamics in adjacent long-term minimally disturbed and disturbed soils from agricultural and forest sites. Light and heavy fractions (LF and HF, respectively) of SOM were collected by physical density separation using sodium polytungstate. Aerobic C and N mineralization of soil (WS), soil plus HF (S+HF) and soil plus LF (S+LF) mixtures were determined. Between 0.8\% and 1.7\% of C and 0.3\% and 1.2\% of N from WS was mineralized after 28 days. The proportion of C mineralized from HF was negligible in all sites, suggesting that the HF component of soils could be a major sink for C storage in soils. Larger proportions of N from HF were mineralized in disturbed than minimally-disturbed soils, suggesting greater protection of N in the HF of disturbed soils. The proportion of C mineralized from LF ranged from \`A0.3\% to 3.2\%, and was not consistent with C mineralization dynamics from the HF component of soils. It appeared that, while the LF component of soil contained C that was chemically and, to a lesser extent, physically protected from decomposition, more C was potentially mineralizable from the LF than the HF component of the agricultural and forest soils examined. In most soils, LF additions resulted in N immobilization rather than N mineralization. Our results indicate that HF is the main source of potentially mineralizable N whereas LF is a potential sink for mineral N, regardless of land management practices, in the agricultural and forest soils we examined. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Compared with traditional models, the microbial model simulates soil C pools that more closely match contemporary observations. It also projects a much wider range of soil C responses to climate change over the twenty-first century. Global soils accumulate C if microbial growth efficiency declines with warming in the microbial model. If growth efficiency adapts to warming, the microbial model projects large soil C losses. By comparison, traditional models project modest soil C losses with global warming. Microbes also change the soil response to increased C inputs, as might occur with CO2 or nutrient fertilization. In the microbial model, microbes consume these additional inputs; whereas in traditional models, additional inputs lead to C storage. Our results indicate that ESMs should simulate microbial physiology to more accurately project climate change feedbacks.},

  abstract = {Physical and chemical stabilization, environmental conditions, and organic matter composition all play vital roles in determining the persistence of soil organic matter (SOM). Fundamentally, SOM stability depends on the balance of microbial bioenergetics between the input of energy needed to decompose it (i.e., activation energy; Ea) and the net energy gained (i.e., energy density; ED) from its decomposition. This relationship is complicated in soils by chemical and physical protection mechanisms, which require additional energies to overcome for decomposition to occur. In this study, we analyze the bioenergetics of soil density fractions, which vary in their degrees of organic matter-mineral association, and show that the relationship of ED and Ea has the ability to provide information about relative differences in SOM chemical composition and stability. Our results demonstrate distinct bioenergetic signatures between particulate, light (free and occluded) fractions versus mineral-associated, heavy fractions isolated from soil samples collected at two depths from a climosequence along an elevation gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California. While there were no significant differences in ED and Ea within each fraction across climates, the light fractions (LF) were characterized by larger ED and Ea values, whereas the heavy fractions (HF) were characterized by smaller ED and Ea values. Combined with CHN analyses, we conclude that SOM in HF pools is likely comprised of relatively simple organic compounds that have long turnover rates because of chemical association with soil minerals, whereas the LF pools are comprised of more chemically complex molecules with low chemical reactivity and high Ea.},

  abstract = {Iron (Fe) oxides strongly interact with organic matter in soil and play an important role in the stabilization of organic matter. These processes are often influenced by soil cultivation, including tillage, crop rotation and irrigation. We assessed the effect of Fe oxides on organic carbon (OC) accumulation during the development of soils used for paddy rice production in comparison to non-irrigated cropping systems. Soil samples were taken from two chronosequences derived from uniform parent material in the Zhejiang Province (PR China). Bulk soils and soil fractions were analyzed for OC concentrations, soil mineralogy and soil organic matter (SOM) composition was determined by solid-state  13C NMR spectroscopy. Paddy soils were characterized by increasing OC concentrations, from 18mgg -1 to 30mgg -1, during 2000years of rice cultivation, but OC concentrations of non-paddy soils were low in all age classes (11mgg -1). SOM composition revealed from Solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy did not change during pedogenesis in either chronosequence. Selective enrichment of lignin-derived compounds, caused by long-term paddy rice management, could not be confirmed by the present study. The management of paddy soils creates an environment of Fe oxide formation which was different to those in non-paddy soils. Paddy soils are dominated by poorly crystalline Fe oxides (Fe o) and significantly lower content of crystalline Fe oxides (Fe d-Fe o). This was in contrast to non-paddy soils, which are characterized by high proportions of crystalline Fe oxides. The paddy-specific Fe oxide composition was effective after only 50years of soil development and the proportion Fe oxides did not alter during further pedogenesis. This chronosequence study revealed that the potential for OC accumulation was higher in paddy versus non-paddy soils and was already reached at earliest stages of paddy soil development. Changes in paddy soil management associated with redox cycle changes will not only affect Fe oxide composition of paddy soils but most probably also OC storage potential. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {14C-labelled glucose or ryegrass was incubated (aerobieally, at 25\textdegree C; each substrate added at either 500 or 5000 {$\mu$}g C g-1soil) with soil from permanent grassland. Soil microbial biomass was measured periodically during the incubation by the fumigation-extraction method. A 20 day incubation with the large addition of glucose (5000 {$\mu$}g C) caused the 'native' (i.e. unlabelled) microbial biomass to fall by half. The large addition of glucose caused a short-lived but marked priming effect and the size of this effect was consistent with its having been caused by a glucose-induced kill of native microbial biomass. Glucose added at 500 {$\mu$}g C did not cause a measurable kill of native microbial biomass, nor did it cause a priming effect. The proportion of glucose C retained in soil was greater throughout the incubation for the small (500{$\mu$}g) than for the large (5000 {$\mu$}g) addition: likewise a greater proportion of the small addition was present in soil microbial biomass C (after 20 days, 21\% of the added C) than of the large addition (13\%). The labelled biomass declined over the 5-10 day period, with a half-life of 60 days. By contrast, labelled ryegrass added at 5000 {$\mu$}g C had little effect on the native microbial biomass, with the newly-synthesized labelled biomass merely adding to that already present. By 40 days, 12\% of this ryegrass C was present as labelled microbial biomass, which then declined with a half-life of 66 days. After 30 days the proportion of labelled ryegrass C retained in soil was greater with the small than with the large addition. Again, a greater proportion of the small addition was present in soil microbial C (after 20 days 19\% of the added C) than of the large addition (12\%). Both the 500 and 5000 {$\mu$}g additions of ryegrass C caused positive priming effects over the 10-100 day period. \textcopyright{} 1993.},

  abstract = {Rewetting a dry soil has long been known to cause a burst of respiration (the ``Birch Effect''). Hypothesized mechanisms for this involve: (1) release of cellular materials as a result of the rapid increase in water potential stress and (2) stimulating C-supply to microbes via physical processes. The balance of these factors is still not well understood, particularly in the contexts of multiple dry/wet cycles and of how resource and stress patterns vary through the soil profile. We evaluated the effects of multiple dry/ wet cycles on surface and subsurface soils from a California annual grassland. Treatments included 4, 6, and 12 cycles that varied the length of the drying period between rewetting events. Respiration was monitored after each wetting event while extractable C and N, microbial biomass, and microbial activity were assayed initially, after the first rewetting event, and at the end of the experiment. Initially, microbial biomass and activity (respiration, dehydrogenase, and N mineralization) in subsurface soils were ca. 10\% and 20\% of surface soil levels. After multiple cycles, however, subsurface soil microbial biomass and activity were enhanced by up to 8-fold, even in comparison to the constantly moist treatment. By comparison, surface soil microbial biomass and activity were either moderately (i.e. 1.5 times increase) or not affected by wetting and drying. Drying and rewetting led to a cascade of responses (soluble C release, biomass growth, and enhanced activity) that mobilized and metabolized otherwise unavailable soil carbon, particularly in subsurface soils.},

The magnitude and controls of MMQ at regional scale remain uncertain. We compiled a comprehensive data set of MMQ to investigate the global patterns and controls of MMQ in top 30 cm soils. Published MMQ values, generally measured in laboratory microcosms, were adjusted on ambient soil temperature using long-term (30 yr) average site soil temperature and a Q 10 = 2. The area-weighted global average of MMQ\_Soil is estimated as 1.8 (1.5\textendash 2.2) (95\% confidence interval) lmol C\'Ah \`A1 \'Ammol \`A1 microbial biomass carbon (MBC) with substantial variations across biomes and between cropland and natural ecosystems. Variation was most closely associated with biological factors, followed by edaphic and meteorological parameters. MMQ\_Soil was greatest in sandy clay and sandy clay loam and showed a pH maximum of 6.7 AE 0.1 (mean AE se). At large scale, MMQ\_Soil varied with latitude and mean annual tem-perature (MAT), and was negatively correlated with microbial N:P ratio, supporting growth rate theory. These trends led to large differences in MMQ\_Soil between natural ecosystems and cropland. When MMQ was adjusted to 11\textdegree C (MMQ\_Ref), the global MAT in the top 30 cm of soils, the area-weighted global averages of MMQ\_Ref was 1.5 (1.3\textendash 1.8) lmol C\'Ammol MBC \`A1 \'Ah \`A1 . The values, trends, and controls of MMQ\_Soil add to our under-standing of soil microbial influences on soil carbon cycling and could be used to represent microbial activity in global carbon models.},

  abstract = {Purpose Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a labile and reactive fraction of soil organic matter. Ultisol usually has low content of organic matter. Fertilization is a normal way in regulating the state of soil organic matter. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different fertilizations on the content, distribution, structure, and biodegradability of DOM from Ultisol. Materials and methods Ultisol treated by no fertilizer (Ck), chemical fertilizer (NPK), the mixture of chemical fertilizer and straw (NPKS), and animal manure (AM) were collected from a long-term fertilization experimental site. Soil DOM was extracted by deionized water with solid to water ratio of 1:5. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon and total soluble nitrogen in DOM was determined by TOC analyzer. The structure of DOM was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy through the emission spectra, excitation spectra, synchronous-scan spectra, and excitation-emission matrix. Soil DOM was incubated for 21 days after the addition of soil microbial inoculum and nutrient solution, the biodegradability of DOM was estimated by calculating the percentage of dissolved organic carbon lost after 21 days of incubation. Results and discussion The content of dissolved organic carbon in the soil of Ck, NPK, NPKS, and AM was 22.14, 27.05, 36.08, and 56.04 mg/kg, respectively. The distribution of dissolved organic carbon on large macroaggregate increased from 47.0\% in Ck to 65.0\textendash 71.5\% in fertilized treatments but that on small macroaggregate decreased from 35.5\% in Ck to 18.3\textendash 19.9\% in fertilized treatments. Similar peak wavelength and a fluorophore at wavelength pair of 330\textendash 340ex/406\textendash 422em were found in all examined DOM. However, a sequence of AM {$>$} NPKS {$>$} NPK {$>$} Ck was found in the fluorescence intensity of examined DOM, indicating the simplification of DOM structure induced by fertilization. The biodegradability of DOM from the Ck, NPK, NPKS, and AM treatment after 21 days of incubation was 23.9, 28.7, 34.2, and 42.7\%, respectively. Conclusions Organic and inorganic fertilization increased the content of DOM from Ultisol. Compared to the Ck treatment, the fertilization treatments increased the distribution of dissolved organic carbon on large macroaggregate but reduced its distribution on small macroaggregate. Humic acid-like compounds were the dominant fractions in DOM from all treatments. DOM from Ck and NPK treatments had more complex molecular structure and lower biodegradability than that from NPKS and AM treatments.},

  abstract = {Labile soil organic carbon pools are valuable indicators of soil quality, early changes in soil total organic carbon (TOC) stocks, and (hence) changes in soil carbon sequestration pools and dynamics induced by changes in soil management practices. To improve the management of loess soils in China, we have examined effects of soil and nutrient management treatments applied in a 20-year experiment on TOC and the following fractions: particulate organic carbon (POC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and permanganate oxidizable carbon (KMnO4 C). The soil management regimes were cropland abandonment (Abandonment), bare fallow without vegetation (Fallow) and a wheat-maize cropping system (Cropping). Cropping was combined with the following nutrient management treatments: control (CK, no nutrient input), nitrogen only (N), nitrogen and potassium (NK), phosphorus and potassium (PK), NP, NPK, straw plus NPK (SNPK) and two levels of manure (M, 13.7 and 20.6 t ha-1) plus NPK (M1NPK and M2NPK). After 20 years, the Fallow treatment resulted in significantly lower TOC by 22\% and labile C fractions by 29\%\textendash 43\% except MBC than Cropping, while Abandonment markedly increased all labile C fractions by 43\%\textendash 64\% except POC relative to Cropping, but the Abandonment and Cropping regimes resulted in similar TOC contents (10.75 g kg-1 and 10.16 g kg-1, respectively). Of the four C fractions, LFOC and KMnO4 C were the most sensitive indicators of changes in TOC induced by the soil management regimes. Under Cropping, TOC contents were similar in NP, NPK and SNPK plots, and significantly higher than those in CK plots (by 34\%, 32\% and 45\%, respectively). Manure addition further enhanced TOC contents, which were highest following the M2NPK treatment (13.88 g kg-1). Labile C fractions were also significantly higher following the treatments including organic amendment than following applications solely of chemical fertilizers, except that the SNPK, NP and NPK treatments resulted in similar LFOC contents. Application solely of chemical fertilizers had no significant effects on LFOC and KMnO4 C fractions compared with CK. Nevertheless, application of NP or NPK significantly increased contents of POC and MBC relative to CK (by 115\% and 90\% or 31\% and 53\%, respectively). Thus, LFOC and KMnO4 C fractions were not sensitive indicators of changes in TOC induced by mineral nutrient management practices under current conditions. Overall, given the minor differences between the effects of the NP and NPK treatments, application of manure and NP appears to be the most suitable management practice for improving TOC sequestration in the loess soil.},

Recent meta-analyses of fungal diversity using deeply sequenced marker genes suggest that most fungal taxa are locally distributed. However, little is known about the extent of overlap and niche partitions in total fungal communities or functional guilds within distinct habitats on a local forest scale. Here, we compared fungal communities in endosphere (leaf interior), phyllosphere (leaf interior and associated surface area) and soil samples from an Erman's birch forest in Changbai Mountain, China. Community structures were significantly differentiated in terms of habitat, with soil having the highest fungal richness and phylogenetic diversity. Endophytic and phyllosphere fungi of Betula ermanii were more phylogenetically clustered compared with the corresponding soil fungi, indicating the ability of that host plants to filter and select their fungal partners. Furthermore, the majority of soil fungal taxa were soil specialists, while the dominant endosphere and phyllosphere taxa were aboveground generalists, with soil and plant foliage only sharing {$<$} 8.2\% fungal taxa. Most of the fungal taxa could be assigned to different functional guilds; however, the assigned guilds showed significant habitat specificity with variation in relative abundance. Collectively, the fungal assemblages in this Erman's birch forest were strictly niche specialized and constrained by weak migration among habitats. The findings suggest that phylogenetic relatedness and functional guilds' assignment can effectively interpret the certain ecological processes.},

Two community based microbiological measurements, namely, community level physiological profiling (CLPP) using Biolog sole C source utilization tests and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles, were used to investigate the microbial ecology of these soils and to determine how land use alters microbial community structure. Microbial biomass-C and total PLFAs were closely correlated to organic carbon and total nitrogen, indicating that these soil microbial measures are potentially good indices of soil fertility in these highly weathered soils. Metabolic quotients and C source utilization were not correlated with organic carbon or microbial biomass. Multivariate analysis of sole carbon source utilization patterns and PLFAs demonstrated that land use history and plant cover type had a significant impact on microbial community structure. PLFAs showed these differences more than CLPP methods. Consequently, PLFA analysis was a better method for assessing broad-spectrum community differences and at the same time attempting to correlate changes with soil fertility. Soils from tea orchards were particularly distinctive in their CLPP. A modified CLPP method, using absorbance readings at 405 nm and different culture media at pH values of 4.7 and 7.0, showed that the discrimination obtained can be influenced by the culture conditions. This method was used to show that the distinctive microbial community structure in tea orchard soils was not, however, due to differences in pH alone.},

This study investigated the effects of soil structure and its interaction with soil water content on C mineralization. Dry aggregate samples (0\textendash 2, 2\textendash 4, 4\textendash 8, 8\textendash 16 mm) obtained from agricultural field (AGRIC) and an adjacent less-disturbed area maintained under prairie vegetation (PRAIRIE) were subjected to a short-term incubation where soil water was maintained at four gravimetric water contents ranging from 5\% to 50\%. More water was needed to maximize C mineralization in larger sized aggregates supporting the notion that biological activity is located at the surface of aggregates or within pores located adjacent to their surface. Mean C mineralization rate was 54\% greater from the PRAIRIE than the AGRIC soils, which contained 66.1 and 24.9 mg SOC g\`A 1 soil, respectively. However, mean specific C mineralization rates (mg C\textendash CO2 / mg-SOC ) were 45\% lower from the PRAIRIE than from the AGRIC treatment, suggesting that physical protection of SOC was greater in that soil. The greater volume of macropores (N300 Am) in the PRAIRIE aggregates may have contributed to its accumulation of humified SOC by limiting microbial usage of C in air filled pores. The volume of water holding pores (b 30 Am), which was lower in the aggregates from the PRAIRE than AGRIC treatment, was saturated in the PRAIRE aggregates at the wettest treatment. As a result, localized anaerobism restricted C mineralization in the PRAIRE but not in the AGRIC aggregates where water holding pores were not yet saturated. Differences in size distribution of pores in aggregates collected from the two soils considered affected the physical availability of substrates and optimum soil water conditions for biological activity. By considering macropores as regions of where C decay is restricted and by assessing the status of pores b 30 Am (water held at \`A 10 kPa), we can better understand spatial constraints on C mineralization.

The study was carried out at Lavark experimental farm in plots receiving 0 (T1), 25 (T2), 50 (T3) and 100 (T4) Mg/ha of manure for 5 years successively with a cropping rotation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-corn (Zea mays L.) every year and plots under similar chemical fertilizer management but with three different cropping rotations (T5, T6 and T7) that has been the prevalent cropping systems. Three replications of soil sample in each treatment and at the depths of 0-5 and 5-15 cm were used to measure organic carbon (OC), hot-water-soluble carbohydrate, dilute acid hydrolysable carbohydrate, cold-water-soluble carbohydrate and mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates. The highest amount of carbohydrate (700 mg/kg) and aggregate stability (0.8 mm) were obtained in plots with 100 Mg/ha manure (T4). The amount of carbohydrate extracted from soil samples decreased in the order of hot water, dilute acid and cold water extracts. Aggregate stability had a better correlation with hot water (r = 0.74**) and dilute acid-soluble carbohydrate (r = 0.73**) than organic carbon (r = 0.62**) content of soil. This indicates that the carbohydrate extracted by hot water and dilute acid may be a suitable indicator for showing soil quality, particularly in relation to soil aggregation. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {A long-term field experiment was established in September 1989 to examine the influence of mineral fertilizer and compost on soil fertility in an intensively cultivated fluvo-aquic soil in the North China plain. The study involved seven treatments: compost (CM), half-compost plus half-fertilizer N (HCM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NP (NP), fertilizer NK (NK), fertilizer PK (PK) and control without any fertilizer (CK). The mass and organic C concentration of aggregates ({$>$}250{$\mu$}m macroaggregate, 53\textendash 250{$\mu$}m microaggregate, and {$<$}53{$\mu$}m free silt+clay fraction) and subfractions within aggregates, including intra particulate organic matter (iPOM) and silt+clay subfraction, were measured to evaluate the process of aggregation and organic C accumulation. The long-term application of mineral fertilizers had no obvious effects on the mass proportion of aggregate, and in contrast, compost significantly increased the mass proportion of macroaggregates from 8.8\% in CK soil to 17.7\textendash 30.8\% in compost-added soils. This increase was at the expense of microaggregates and free silt+clay fraction. Soil organic C concentrations were significantly increased in the CM and HCM treatments by 124\% and 72\%, respectively, but less than 27\% increase was observed in mineral fertilizer-added soils over an 18-year period (compared with CK soil). Amendment with mineral fertilizer NPK mainly increased organic C concentrations in macroaggregates and particularly in the free silt+clay fraction. In contrast, compost application mainly accelerated organic C accumulation in macroaggregates by increasing the amount of C in the silt+clay subfraction rather than iPOM, which accounted for 47\textendash 58\% of the increased organic C in soil. This was because of the mass proportion increase in macroaggregates. The mass proportion of macroaggregates was significantly related with organic C concentration in microaggregate and free silt+clay fractions (P=0.005). The mass ratio of macroaggregates plus microaggregates to the free silt+clay fraction (P=0.015) and macroaggregates to microaggregates (P=0.003) was significantly correlated with organic C concentration in the free silt+clay fraction. These results indicated that the increase of soil organic C in compost-added soil was possibly due first to the enhancement of organic C concentration in the free silt+clay fraction, which in turn promoted the formation of microaggregates and/or macroaggregates. We consider that the increase of organic C concentration in the free silt+clay fraction is likely to play a key role in aggregation and C sequestration.},

Conclusions: Overall, we concluded that different land use types exerted greater impacts on soil microbial biomass and community structures than fertilization regimes in the Luvisol soil.

Here, we showed that organic amendments in three long-term (23, 154, and 170 yrs, respectively) field experiments significantly increased mineral availability, particularly of short-range-ordered (SRO) phases. Two microcosm studies demonstrated that the presence of roots significantly increased mineral availability and promoted the formation of SRO phases. Mineral transformation experiments and isotopic labeling experiments provided direct evidence that citric acid, a major component of root exudates, promoted the formation of SRO minerals, and that SRO minerals acted as ``nuclei'' for C retention. Together, these findings indicate that soil organic amendments initialize a positive feedback loop by increasing mineral availability and promoting the formation of SRO minerals for further C binding, thereby possibly serving as a management tool for enhancing carbon storage in soils.},

A complex network of functions and symbiotic interactions between a eukaryotic host and its microbiome is a the foundation of the ecological unit holobiont. However, little is known about how the non-fungal eukaryotic microorganisms fit in this complex network of host-microbiome interactions. In this study, we employed a unique wild blueberry ecosystem to evaluate plant-associated microbiota, encompassing both eukaryotic and bacterial communities. We found that, while soil microbiome serves as a foundation for root microbiome, plant-influenced species sorting had stronger effect on eukaryotes than on bacteria. Our study identified several fungal and protist taxa, which are correlated with decreased fruit production in wild blueberry agricultural ecosystems. The specific effect of species sorting in root microbiome resulted in an increase in relative abundance of fungi adapted to plant-associated life-style, while the relative abundance of non-fungal eukaryotes was decreased along the soil-endosphere continuum in the root, probably because of low adaptation of these microorganisms to host-plant defense responses. Analysis of community correlation networks indicated that bacterial and eukaryotic interactions became more complex along the soil-endosphere continuum and, in addition to  extensive mutualistic interactions, co-exclusion also played an important role in shaping wild blueberry associated microbiome. Our study identified several potential hub taxa with important roles in soil fertility and/or plant-microbe interaction, suggesting the key role of these taxa in the interconnection between soils and plant health and overall microbial community structure. This study also provides a comprehensive view of the role of non-fungal eukaryotes in soil ecosystem.},

After seven years of plant growth, we determined the composition and function of soil microbial communities beneath experimental plant diversity treatments containing 1\textendash 16 species. Microbial community biomass, respiration, and fungal abundance significantly increased with greater plant diversity, as did N mineralization rates. However, changes in microbial community biomass, activity, and composition largely resulted from the higher levels of plant production associated with greater diversity, rather than from plant diversity per se. Nonetheless, greater plant production could not explain more rapid N mineralization, indicating that plant diversity affected this microbial process, which controls rates of ecosystem N cycling. Greater N availability probably contributed to the positive relationship between plant diversity and productivity in the N-limited soils of our experiment, suggesting that plant\textendash microbe interactions in soil are an integral component of plant diversity's influence on ecosystem function.},

We used measurements of the 13carbon (13C) signature of soil-respired CO2 ({$\delta$}13CO2) immediately after the disturbance caused by coring and sampling the soil, to assess labile SOM availability and potential vulnerability to loss. We incubated a range of pasture soils over 300 minutes and periodically measured {$\delta$}13CO2. Strong temporal trends in {$\delta$}13CO2 suggest that labile SOM became vulnerable to loss within minutes of soil disturbance. Equilibrium soil-respired {$\delta$}13CO2 values were a function of the amount of labile SOM (measured as hot-water extractable C, HWEC), total soil C and soil protection capacity (measured as specific soil surface area, SSA). An independent experimental approach that immobilized labile SOM on to allophane (a clay mineral with a large active surface area) was used to assess the effect of SSA on equilibrium soil-respired {$\delta$}13CO2. In this experiment {$\delta$}13CO2 shifted progressively to more enriched values during the first six days of soil incubations after allophane addition, suggesting that labile SOM became less available after stabilization by allophane. At the same time there was a large reduction in HWEC when compared with the control treatments, also indicating limited availability of labile SOM. Further studies coupling the isotopic measurements with CO2 evolution rates are needed to test directly whether equilibrium {$\delta$}13CO2 can reflect labile SOM vulnerability to loss.},

On the basis of chemical analyses, 53 days of composting sewage sludge with structural material can be divided into three phases: (i) domination of rapid decomposition of non-humic, easily biodegradable organic matter (two to three weeks), (ii) domination of organic matter humification and formation of polycondensed, humic-like substances (the next two weeks), (iii) stabilization of transformed organic material and weak microbial activity. Spectroscopic characterization (13C NMR) of compost humic acids reveals changes in their structures during maturation. The changes are highly correlated with the processes taking place in bulk compost.},

The connectance of the bacterial and predator-prey pathways was greater in NT and RT than in CT and that of fungal pathway was greatest in RT. The trophic relationship of the bacterial and predator-prey pathways was strengthened due to the higher water content of soil and the lower NO3--N after the conversion of CT to NT and RT.

In an additional comparison, defaunated soil was amended with mineral fertilizer solution for comparison with the mineralization service of the soil fauna. Management systems using cover crops, which created a continuity of both photosynthetic production and roots in the soil, strongly enhanced the nematode assemblages in the field soil. Management systems with cover crops had greater total abundance, measured as numbers, biomass and metabolic footprints, of nematodes, and also of the functional guilds of nematodes considered important in soil fertility and as prey for predators. Leachates from soil columns with intact nematode assemblages had greater total mineral nitrogen and supported greater plant growth than those from defaunated columns.

  abstract = {Our aim was to determine if soil ergosterol concentration provides a quantitative estimate of the soil fungal biomass concentration, as is usually assumed. This was done by comparing soil ergosterol measurements with soil fungal biomass (fungal biomass C) concentrations estimated by microscopic measurements and by the selective inhibition technique linked to substrate-induced respiration (SIR). The measurements were compared in a silty-clay loam soil given a range of previous treatments designed to increase or decrease the soil fungal biomass and so also to change the soil ergosterol concentration. The treatments used were ryegrass amendment, to increase the total and fungal biomass, and CHCl3-fumigation and the addition of the biocides, captan, bronopol and dinoseb, to decrease both ergosterol and fungal biomass C concentrations. The mineralization of ergosterol following addition to sand innoculated with soil extract, and to a sandy loam soil, was also determined. The added ergosterol was little, if at all, degraded following addition to either sand or the unfumigated or fumigated soil during a 10 d aerobic incubation. Similarly, pesticide addition did not significantly change soil ergosterol concentrations yet the soil fungal biomass C concentration decreased significantly. Thus, the ratio: (soil ergosterol concentration/soil fungal biomass C concentration) was much higher in the pesticide-treated soils than the control soil. Following ryegrass amendment, soil ergosterol concentration increased from about 6-12 {$\mu$}g-1soil within 5 d and then decreased gradually to about 7 {$\mu$}g g-1soil by 20 d incubation. Changes in fungal biomass C (measured by direct microscopy) closely mirrored changes in soil ergosterol over this period. However, when the amended soil was fumigated and then incubated for a further 5 d, the initial ergosterol concentration declined from 7 to 5 {$\mu$}g g-1soil by 20 d incubation (a decline of about 0.4). The comparable decline in fungal biomass C was about eight-fold. Thus the ratio of ergosterol to fungal biomass C increased from 0.005 to about 0.01. There was a significant correlation (r{$>$}0.84, P{$<$}0.001) between soil ergosterol concentration and fungal biomass measured by either SIR or microscopy. However, three data points played a vital role in the correlation. When these points were excluded the relationship was very poor (r{$<$}0.4). Our results therefore suggest that substantial amounts of ergosterol may exist, other than in living cells, for considerable periods, with little, if any mineralization. Thus, these results indicate that ergosterol and fungal biomass C concentrations are not always closely correlated, due to the slow metabolism of ergosterol in recently dead fugal biomass and/or the existence of exocellular ergosterol in soil. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This region also suffers from serious soil erosion. For that reason, afforestation of arable soils has taken place.

Therefore, we measured C mineralization in a 35days incubation experiment and analyzed amounts and properties of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) in 12 topsoils of this region. The soils differed in land use (arable vs. forest) and in amounts of added organic manure. Afforestation of arable soils resulted in a distinct stabilization of organic C as indicated by the smallest C mineralization (0.48 mg C g\`A1 C d\`A1) and the highest C content (2.3\%) of the studied soils. In the soils exposed to intensive crop production without regular addition of organic manure we found the largest C mineralization (0.85 mg C g\`A1 C d\`A1) and the lowest contents of organic C (0.9\%). Addition of organic manure over a time scale of millennia resulted in high organic C contents (1.8\%) and small C mineralization (0.55 mg C g\`A1 C d\`A1). The content of WEOC reflected differences in C mineralization between the soils quite well and the two variables correlated significantly. Water-extractable organic C decreased during C mineralization from the soil illustrating its mainly labile character. Carbon mineralization from soils was particularly large in soils with small specific UV absorbance of WEOC. We conclude that amounts and properties of WEOC reflected differences in the stability of soil organic C. Both afforestation of arable land and the long-term addition of organic manure may contribute to C accumulation and stabilization in these soils.},

  abstract = {The effects of mineral fertilizer (NPK) and organic manure on phospholipid fatty acid profiles and microbial functional diversity were investigated in a long-term (21-year) fertilizer experiment. The experiment included nine treatments: organic manure (OM), organic manure plus fertilizer NPK (OM + NPK), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NP (NP), fertilizer NK (NK), fertilizer N (N), fertilizer P (P), fertilizer K (K), and the control (CK, without fertilization). The original soil was extremely eroded, characterized by low pH and deficiencies of nutrients, particularly N and P. The application of OM and OM + NPK greatly increased crop yields, soil pH, organic C, total N, P and K, available N, P and K content. Crop yields, soil pH, organic C, total N and available N were also clearly increased by the application of mineral NPK fertilizer. The amounts of total PLFAs, bacterial, Gram-negative and actinobacterial PLFAs were highest in the OM + NPK treatment, followed by the OM treatment, whilst least in the N treatment. The amounts of Gram-positive and anaerobic PLFAs were highest in the OM treatment whilst least in the P treatment and the control, respectively. The amounts of aerobic and fungal PLFAs were highest in the NPK treatment whilst least in the N and P treatment, respectively. The average well color development (AWCD) was significantly increased by the application of OM and OM + NPK, and the functional diversity indices including Shannon index (H{${'}$}), Simpson index (D) and McIntosh index (U) were also significantly increased by the application of OM and OM + NPK. Principal component analysis (PCA) of PLFA profiles and C source utilization patterns were used to describe changes in microbial biomass and metabolic fingerprints from nine fertilizer treatments. The PLFA profiles from OM, OM + NPK, NP and NPK were significantly different from that of CK, N, P, K and NK, and C source utilization patterns from OM and OM + NPK were clearly different from organic manure deficient treatments (CK, N, P, K, NP, NK 6 and NPK). Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that total N, available P and soil pH significantly affected PLFA profiles and microbial functional diversity. Our results could provide a better understanding of the importance of organic manure plus balanced fertilization with N, P and K in promoting the soil microbial biomass, activity and diversity and thus enhancing crop growth and production.},

Although microorganisms catalyse most biosphere processes related to fluxes of greenhouse gases, little is known about the microbial role in regulating future climate change. Integrated metagenomic and functional analyses of a long-term warming experiment in a grassland ecosystem showed that microorganisms play crucial roles in regulating soil carbon dynamics through three primary feedback mechanisms: shifting microbial community composition, which most likely led to the reduced temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic soil respiration; differentially stimulating genes for degrading labile but not recalcitrant carbon so as to maintain long-term soil carbon stability and storage; and enhancing nutrient-cycling processes to promote plant nutrient-use efficiency and hence plant growth. Elucidating microbially mediated feedbacks is fundamental to understanding ecosystem responses to climate warming and provides a mechanistic basis for carbon-climate modelling. \textcopyright{} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Microbial metabolism plays a key role in regulating the biogeochemical cycle of forest ecosystems, but the mechanisms driving microbial growth are not well understood. Here, we synthesized 689 measurements on soil microbial biomass carbon (C\textsubscript{mic}) and nitrogen (N\textsubscript{mic}) and related parameters from 207 independent studies published up to November 2014 across China's forest ecosystems. Our objectives were to (1) examine patterns in C\textsubscript{mic}, N\textsubscript{mic}, and microbial quotient (i.e., C\textsubscript{mic} / C\textsubscript{soil} and N\textsubscript{mic} / N\textsubscript{soil} rates) by climate zones and management regimes for these forests; and (2) identify the factors driving the variability in the C\textsubscript{mic}, N\textsubscript{mic}, and microbial quotient. There was a large variability in C\textsubscript{mic} (390.2 mg kg\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}), N\textsubscript{mic} (60.1 mg kg\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}, C\textsubscript{mic} : N\textsubscript{mic} ratio (8.25), C\textsubscript{mic} / C\textsubscript{soil} rate (1.92 \%), and N\textsubscript{mic} / N\textsubscript{soil} rate (3.43 \%) across China's forests. The natural forests had significantly greater C\textsubscript{mic} (514.1 mg kg\textsuperscript{-1} vs. 281.8 mg kg\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}) and N\textsubscript{mic} (82.6 mg kg\textsuperscript{-1} vs. 39.0 mg kg\textsuperscript{\&minus;1}) than the planted forests, but had less C\textsubscript{mic} : N\textsubscript{mic} ratio (7.3 vs. 9.2) and C\textsubscript{mic} / C\textsubscript{soil} rate (1.7 \% vs. 2.1 \%). Soil resources and climate together explained 24.4\textendash 40.7 \% of these variations. The C\textsubscript{mic} : N\textsubscript{mic} ratio declined slightly with C\textsubscript{soil} : N\textsubscript{soil} ratio, and changed with latitude, mean annual temperature and precipitation, suggesting a plasticity of microbial carbon-nitrogen stoichiometry. The C\textsubscript{mic} / C\textsubscript{soil} rate decreased with C\textsubscript{soil} : N\textsubscript{soil} ratio, whereas the N\textsubscript{mic} / N\textsubscript{soil} rate increased with C\textsubscript{soil} : N\textsubscript{soil} ratio; the former was influenced more by soil resources than by climate, whereas the latter was influenced more by climate. These results suggest that soil microbial assimilation of carbon and nitrogen are jointly driven by soil resources and climate, but may be regulated by different mechanisms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Aim: The aim was to explore how conversions of primary or secondary forests to plantations or agricultural systems influence soil microbial communities and soil carbon (C) cycling.  Location: Global. Time period: 1993\textendash 2017. Major taxa studied: Soil microbes. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to examine effects of forest degradation on soil properties and microbial attributes related to microbial biomass, activity, community composition and diversity based on 408 cases from 119 studies in the world. Results: Forest degradation decreased the ratios of K-strategists to r-strategists (i.e., ratios of fungi to bacteria, Acidobacteria to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria to Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria\,+\,Actinobacteria to Proteobacteria\,+\,Bacteroidetes). The response ratios (RRs) of the K-strategist to r-strategist ratios to forest degradation decreased and increased with increased RRs of soil pH and soil C to nitrogen ratio (C:N), respectively. Forest degradation increased the bacterial alpha-diversity indexes, of which the RRs increased and decreased as the RRs of soil pH and soil C:N increased, respectively. The overall RRs across all the forest degradation types ranked as microbial C (-40.4\%)\,{$>$}\,soil C (-33.3\%)\,{$>$}\,microbial respiration (-18.9\%)\,{$>$}\,microbial C to soil C ratio (qMBC; -15.9\%), leading to the RRs of microbial respiration rate per unit microbial C (qCO2) and soil C decomposition rate (respiration rate per unit soil C), on average, increasing by +43.2 and +25.0\%, respectively. Variances of the RRs of qMBC and qCO2 were significantly explained by the soil C, soil C:N and mean annual precipitation. Main conclusions: Forest degradation consistently shifted soil microbial community compositions from K-strategist dominated to r-strategist dominated, altered soil properties and stimulated microbial activity and soil C decomposition. These results are important for modelling the soil C cycling under projected global land-use changes and provide supportive evidence for applying the macroecology theory on ecosystem succession and disturbance in soil microbial ecology.},

  abstract = {Water-stable soil aggregates are generally formed following the addition of organic materials in soils. This process is mediated by the interaction between microbes and soil organic matter in ways that are still not completely understood. To get insight into the effects of decomposing plant residues on aggregate dynamics, a clay soil with an inherently low soil organic carbon (SOC) content, was amended with two different sources of organic matter (alfalfa, C:N = 16.7 and barley straw, C:N = 95.6) at different input levels (0, 10, 20, \& 30 g C kg???1 soil). These were incubated for a period of 3 months over which soil respiration was assessed using the NaOH capture method, water aggregate stability was determined with the mean weight diameter (MWD) by wet sieving, and the relative strength of aggregates exposed to ultrasonic agitation was modelled using the aggregate disruption characteristic curve (ADCC) and soil dispersion characteristic curve (SDCC). As expected, the quality and quantity of organic matter added controlled the respiration rate, with alfalfa (0.457 g CO2[sbnd]C g???1 C for total respiration rate) being greater than barley amended samples (0.178 g CO2[sbnd]C g???1 C) at any C input rate. Both residue quality and quantity of organic matter input also influenced the amount of aggregates formed and their relative strength. The MWD of soils amended with alfalfa residues was greater than that of barley straw at lower input rates and early in the incubation (e.g. at 28???days of incubation and at a rate of 10 g C kg???1 soil, MWD was 575 ??m and 731 ??m for barley straw and alfalfa, respectively). However, in the longer term (84???days of incubation), the use of ultrasonic energy revealed that barley straw resulted in stronger aggregates, especially at higher input rates despite showing similar MWD as alfalfa. The use of ultrasonic agitation, where we quantify the energy required to liberate and disperse aggregates allowed us to differentiate the effects of C inputs on the size of stable aggregates and their relative strength.},

Some of them are fairly obvious such as adsorption and desorption on the filters used to isolate DOM. However, some are subtler such as alteration in the tertiary physicochemical structure of DOM because of cavitation (filtration), concentration (ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis), or decomposition (electrophoresis). These structure changes may not have an influence on a variety of analytical techniques, but they may alter the ability of DOM to interact with certain ecosystem components such as the biota and pollutants. Therefore, the interpretation of the analyses done with such DOM cannot necessarily be extrapolated to in situ conditions. Fluorescence has been found to be a sensitive tool to follow such tertiary structure changes.},
