%
%		\subsubsection{CO$_2 $ respiration and MBC}
%
%			except in the first 10 h of incubation in STR amended samples, no remarkable differences were observed between Org and Min in terms of respiration rates in both STTs. \myRed{In contrast}, notable differences were observed between KWC and Str amended samples, in both the magnitude and the pattern of CO$ _2 $ respiration. compared with KWC, Str had seen higher peak respiration (in both LTTs) as well as a slower and more moderate decline in the days following the peak. these results clearly demonstrate the different nature of these two amendments. \myRed{Wheat straw is known to posses an easily degradable fraction and this fraction is commonly responsible for a pulse of microbial activity early in the decomposition process\myRed{*}, while compost is regarded as a more stable substrate, often persisting for longer periods in the soil\myRed{*}. the short term, stronger respiration response under Str amendment, compared with KWC, is in accordance with its higher lability. a longer lasting effect of KWC on respiration might have been expected, yet this was not observed, as respiration rates quickly declined after the first few hours and remained low for the rest of the incubation. it is likely though, that a longer time frame of observation would have provided a more complete perspective, presumably showing a subsequent increase in respiration for KWC  while the effect of Str amendment would have probably been mostly diminished.}
%
%			\myGreen{\begin{itemize}
%					\item \gls{som}e literature examples for compost and straw amendments and the persistance of their effects.
%					\item it seems that the one week dynamics of KWC amended samples reflected the microbial consumption and breakdown of the relatively small fraction of KWC that was easily available and highly labile, and that utilization of more stable fractions of KWC could have been observed in an extended incubation. (the exsitance of a labile fraction in KWC can be seen in the dark color of the water extract of KWC)
%				\end{itemize}}
%			peak respiration rates for KWC and Str were roughly 2 and 4 times lower than the peak rates observed in the MRE incubation (detailed discussion in later sections), respectively. this descending order of response (KWC $ < $ Str $ < $ MRE ) is in accordance with the lability of these three substrates.\\
%			interestingly, despite higher respiration rates in Str compared with KWC in the first hours of incubation, both LTTs had in fact seen a higher increase in net MBC in the first sampling, under \emph{KWC}, rather than under Str. this implies that the initial pulse of respiration in Str amended samples did not initially translate directly into microbial growth as was presumably the case in KWC amended samples. otherwise, during the rest of the incubation, MBC dynamics in KWC and Str mostly corresponded with their respective respiration trend.
%
%		\subsubsection{WEOC}
%
%			all treatment combinations presented a significant increase in WEOC on the first sampling event which was shortly after followed by a steep decline. the initial increase in WEOC was likely the result of substrate solubilization by water addition and/or microbial action, producing substantial amounts of WEOC. this easily available carbon pool was rapidly and continuously removed in the following days by microbial consumption, resulting in decreased WEOC. this decrease closely coincides with the time frame of maximum respiration, between 0-48 h, after which respiration rates had mostly leveled off. concurrence of WEOC removal with increased Resp levels, also observed for control samples in the preliminary experiment, effectively illustrates the  notion of WEOC as an immediate and labile source of energy for micro-organisms.\\

%
%		\subsubsection{Cultivated compared with non-cultivated}
%%todo how to cite this 'Seven-years of productivity and potential fertility in organically managed...' (ask Asher)
%			Despite our expectations, both cultivated LTTs and especially ORG had resulted in higher baseline values for most parameters, compared with the non-cultivated LTT. Although agricultural intensification and long term fertilization has been repeatedly shown to diminish overall soil health and cause a reduction in \gls{som}, compared with non-cultivated soils \citep{laurance2014, mganga2016, tilman2011}, there is \gls{som}e evidence pointing out that this is not necessarily the case for certain agricultural management scenarios, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments.  For example, \citet{trivedi2016}, in a meta analysis, found that in arid climates, cultivated soils had on average significantly higher values of SOC compared with unmanaged soils. Similarly, repeated analysis of a large data base from soils in the US great plains area, revealed that SOC loss due to cultivation was lowest in low rainfall areas ($ \sim $300 mm MAP)\citep{miller2004, burke1989}. \citet{paz-kagan2014} conducted a research that included soils from the Migda research farm (\~{}30 km from the Gilat Research Center, with similar climatic conditions and soil properties), and found no significant improvement in Soil Quality Index(SQI) (including soil parameters such as \gls{som}, hydraulic conductivity and surface hardness) when transitioning between agricultural land use and a natural ecosystem management. \citet{garcia-orenes2010} found no significant decrease in soil health parameters (TOC, WEOC, MBC, basal respiration) compared with an adjacent abandoned field (\gls{som}e natural vegetation cover) in soils from SW Portugal, treated for one year by  a number of different agricultural practices, including tillage and herbicide use. Although these different treatments were each tested separately (e.g compare tilled soil to non-cultivated soil),as opposed to combined long-term treatments in the current work (e.g. compare conventional management to unmanaged soil ), and lasted for only one year, nonetheless, the outcome of this work, clearly support the notion that certain agricultural practices may not have a detrimental effect on overall soil health when compared with non-cultivated soils in a semi-arid climate context. indeed \gls{som}e practices - in the case García-Orenes’s work, the return of substantial amount of oat straw – can actually cause a significant improvement in soil health parameters, not just compared with a non-cultivated soil but also compared with a natural cover soil ( Mediterranean woodland ).\\
%			Our results provide additional evidence supporting a similar line of evidence. Five years of intense compost application ( $ 6 m^3*year^{-1} $ ) combined with an otherwise conventional management system (Org LTT), increased TOC by almost 60\% over an adjacent uncultivated soil (UNC). Org had also resulted in increased baseline levels of SOC fractions such as MBC, WEOC  and HWES-C  as well as higher basal RESP and higher AS, compared with UNC. \\
%			Evidence from a number of experiments and review analysis, suggest that the net energy influx into the soil ecosystem from plants, can act as a key factor determining the rate and direction of changes in \gls{som} properties  and AS, when comparing cultivated and non-cultivated soils. \\
%			Net primary productivity (NPP) is the net solar energy accumulated by vegetation per unit area and unit time. it is an important proxy of ecosystem function and carbon sequestration capacity\citep{jackson2016}. High NPP levels are likely to increase, besides plant biomass, the allocation of plant carbon and nutrients as root deposits, thus enriching the soil with labile, easily stabilized \gls{om}.  \\
%			\citeauthor{trivedi2016}, compared cultivated and non-cultivated soils in the four major climatic regions of the world, and found the Net Primary Productivity(NPP) index, to be higher for non-cultivated soils in temperate and tropical climates and oppositely lower for non-cultivated soils in arid ecosystems. concurrently these trends where in accordance with SOC trends in soils from these two types of ecosystems, indicating the connection between the build up of \gls{som}  and ecosystem productivty. \citet{bhardwaj2011} presented direct evidence relating the improvement in soil quality indices to increased NPP, when examining a set of long-term intensively managed row crop systems in the upper Midwest part of the USA.
%			Considering the marked differences in management inputs between the cultivated and non-cultivated LTTs in the Gilat long term plots\myGreen{GOP?}, in the form of water, fertilization and seeding, it is very possible that substantial differences in NPP between these two management systems occurred in various periods , especially during the long dry summers typical in this area, in which little  if any significant plant growth is expected in non irrigated soils.
%			In light of these evidences, it is possible that differences in NPP between the cultivated LTTs and the non-cultivated LTT used in the current expdemonstratederiment, may have been at least partly responsible for the observed differences in \gls{som} related properties.
%			This supposition is further supported by field observations and fertility tests from the GOP, where significantly higher crop yields were observed in ORG compared with MIN in various time points \myRed{* (\textit{Seven-years of productivity and potential fertility in organically managed Mediterranean Vertisol and semi-arid Loess soils})}. Although data for the complete calculation of NPP is missing in this long-term experiment, it is conceivable that higher crop yields were also expressed as higher NPP, eventually resulting in increased SOC (and related properties) accrual, an outcome that was observed in the current experiment. The \myRed{\textit{Seven-years of productivity and potential}} also reported increased weed coverage in Org compared with Min. This may have been an additional factor contributing to increased organic matter input in these plots.\\
%			The possible importance of NPP in controling long term \gls{som} dynamics in these LTTs is in accordance with the latest emerging concepts of \gls{som} formation and preservation (\textit{ soil continuum model} ) as these views emphasize the role of a continuous flux of labile organic substances into the soil as a key feature in sustaining high levels of \gls{som}.
%
%		\subsubsection{Organic vs. chemical long-term fertilization}
%
%			We expected 5 years of organic fertilization to increase \gls{som} properties over mineral-only fertilization, and indeed baseline TOC, WEOC and HWES (and HWEC, as observed in preliminary experiment) were significantly higher in ORG. on the other hand, no significant difference was observed between these LTTs in baseline MBC, CO2-Resp (actually higher in MIN samples in preliminary incubation) or AS. This statistical insignificance might be explained by management decisions applied in the GOP in the two years preceding soil sampling for the current experiment. As mentioned before, a zero fertilization period of two years, of which one year was fallow (\myRed{‘no input + fallow period’}), preceded soil sampling. The discontinuation of fertilization inputs practically eliminated management differences between ORG and MIN in that period, and the fallow period is likely to have caused significant reductions in biological activity and aggregate structure\myRed{*}. this two year period may well have resulted in a \myRed{‘blurring effect’}, causing any possible differences in MBC and AS to be considerably reduced.
%			Statistical insignificance in microbial parameters probably also reflects high variability in the results , while it is suggested that the insignificance of differences in AS may be more expressive of actual similarity between these LTTs with regards to this particular feature. High variability of biological soil features such as MBC and respiration is well documented\myRed{*}. It is therefore suggested that the effect of contrasting fertilization schemes on AS persisted throughout this fallow period and were thus significantly detectable in our tests while microbiological parameters tended to fade away more quickly and were therefore less evident.
%
%		\subsubsection{MBC and N}
%
%			baseline MBC levels for all three LTTs were in the range of published data regarding arable soils\citep{gonzalez-quinones2011}. \citet{rotbart2018} measured the seasonal dynamics of MBC in field samples from the same plots used in this work (UNC was not included in that work) and found a range of values mostly between 100-500 \genericunit over a period of more than 3 years (excluding the temporary effect of compost application). These result are similar to the baseline values reported here.
%			in line with our expectations, the long-term organically fertilized LTT, had higher control values throughout most of the incubation period, compared with the long-term minerally fertilized soil. yet these differences were almost all statistically insignificant. The calculated baseline value for MBC was 36\% higher in ORG compared with MIN (non-significant). it is not entirely surprising that the differences between control samples from ORG and MIN in this current experiment were statistically insignificant, considering that no statistical significance was found between these  two LTTs in the majority of 12 field samples taken over a period of more than two years in the work of \citet{rotbart2018}, particularly for sampling dates outside the immediate effect of fertilizer application.\\
%%			\myGreen{statistical insignificance may also be due to 'blurring effect' mentioned in the above section}\\
%			Other works that had examined the effect of long-term fertilization on MBC in semi-arid soils, showed a definite effect of long-term fertilization management on the levels of MBC, with most results indicating an increase of MBC for organically fertilized soils compared with chemically fertilized soils\citep{luo2015, liu2013, ghoshal1995}. it should be noted though, that these above cited results are from experiments spanning considerably longer periods, possibly increasing the likelihood of obtaining clearer and more significant results.\\
%%			Why longer periods would provide clearer results… obvious?
%			ORG and MIN both caused an apparent increase in MBC compared with UNC. This interesting result, discussed earlier in the general context of the effects of cultivation on \gls{som} properties, has little support in literature with regard to MBC levels. indeed many researches present an opposite trend in which long term transition from a non-cultivated, undisturbed soil management to an agriculturally managed system, usually causes a decrease in MBC levels along with decreases in \gls{som} stocks \citep{benbi2015, yu2013,zhou2018}. it is worth noting that many of the works that examined the effect of land use on MBC have been carried out in temperate and tropical climates, in areas where NPP is often considerably higher then in semi-arid and arid climates in the Mediterranean and similar regions.\\
%%			\myGreen{xpand on the fact most works that showed higher MBC in non-cultivated soil compared with arable soils are from temperate or tropical climates, where NPP is liable to be higher in unmanaged, non-cultivated soils. }
%
%		\subsubsection{Cumulative CO2  respiration}
%
%			The average CO2-Resp rate (15.51 \respunit) and respectively the cumulative CO2-Resp (204.4 \cumrespunit) in control samples across the three LTTs, were of similar range as values reported for similar soils under similar conditions. \citet{ribeiro2010} measured 142.5 \genericunit of CO$ _2 $-C respired during a 21 day incubation, from an organically managed soil in SW Portugal (sandy soil, 9.3 $ g * kg^{-1} $ SOC). \citet{rudrappa2006} measured the CO2 mineralization of a soil subjected to different long-term combinations of organic and mineral fertilization, and found a range of between 100-150 \genericunit of cumulative CO$ _2 $-C after 21 days of incubation.
%			The order of cumulative Resp between LTTs was in accordance with baseline MBC levels of MBC. \\
%			\myGreen{expand on that.}
%
%		\subsubsection{HWES}
%
%			Baseline HWES concentrations were similar to those reported by other works for agricultural soils \citep{haynes2005, yousefi2008, puget1998}. HWES are considered sensitive indicators of changes in soil quality\myRed{*}. In this work this parameter was able to significantly distinguish between the different long-term treatments.\\
%			Similar to our results, both \citet{yousefi2008} and \citet{bottinelli2017} had found increased levels of HWES in organically, or organically combined with chemically fertilized soils compared with chemical-only fertilized soils.
%			In the work of \citet{yousefi2008}, long-term (5 years) manure fertilized soils, in three rates of application  25, 50 and 100 $ Mg * ha^{-1} * yr^{-1}  $ , increased the concentration of HWES by roughly 20, 100 and 300 \genericunit compared with a chemically fertilized soil, respectively. The chemical fertilizer treatment, in that work also differed from the manure treatments in its crop rotation scheme, which included a fallow period between consecutive crops. This The \~{}100 \genericunit increase in HWES observed in ORG compared with MIN in the current experiment, is comparable to the results presented by \citeauthor{yousefi2008} for the 50 Mg/ha manure treatment, which was similar to the 38 $ Mg * ha^{-1} * yr^{-1}  $ of compost applied annually in ORG.
%			\citet{bottinelli2017}, compared soils treated for 7 years with either ammonium nitrate or poultry manure (manure was supplemented with mineral N to yield equivalent amounts of nitrogen), their results  showed a significant increase (\~{}100 \genericunit) in HWES for the poultry manure treatment compared with the mineral fertilizer-only treatment.
%			Compared with the difference observed between ORG and MIN in this current work, which amounted to more than 30\% increase, the increase as a percent of the  chemically treated soil, presented by Bottinelli, was much smaller at 7\%. This was attributed to the low annual application rate of manure ( 17 $ Mg * ha^{-1} * yr^{-1}  $ ) as well as high initial HWES and \gls{om} content in that soil.
%
%		\subsubsection{WEOC}
%
%			DOC is often correlated with SOC content and has been regarded as being in equilibrium with the solid phase \gls{som} \citep{malik2013}. In this work, the number of data points was not sufficient to produce meaningful statistical relationship between these two parameters. Nonetheless, the clear separation between Org and the two other LTTs in both SOC and WEOC suggest that a considerable association existed between these two parameters for non-amended samples in this incubation. In the current work this association is reflected in the fact that baseline SOC level seemed to correlate with WEOC (and with HWES which likely also implies a correlation with HWEC as it has been demonstrated that HWE total carbon and carbohydrates maintiand a costant ratio in non-amended samples).
%		    Baseline WEOC values were comparable to literature reported results from soils of similar SOC content. Evidence from Long term fertilization plots in central china, presented WEOC concentrations in the range of 25-55 \genericunit for NPK and pig manure fertilized plots respectively\citep{xu2018}. These values are a little lower than our calculated baseline values yet they compare very similarly to the initial WEOC levels that we measured (immediately after the first water addition, that is  at the end of a 5 days pre-incubation period at a constant 50\% WHC water content). \citet{hamkalo2014} reported similar values, with an average of \~{}40 \genericunit for the 0-15cm  soil layer in a manure and NPK fertilized soil (\~{}1.6\% SOC).
%
%   		\subsubsection{Aggregate Stability}
%%todo find citation for 'rapid decline in AS when the inflow of \gls{om} is stoped'
%   			A significantly higher baseline AS was observed for the cultivated LTTs in our experiment. This is in line with the other results reported here, showing a clear advantage for agricultural management (particularly combining compost fertilization) compared with non-cultivated soil, in this specific context, with regard to increasing \gls{som} stocks and enhancing related soil properties (such as biological activity, i.e MBC and respiration). Long term fertilization treatments (ORG and MIN), on the other hand, could not be statistically separated based on AS values. ORG had a higher AS baseline value than MIN, yet this difference was not significant, possibly due to the \textit{blurring effect} mentioned earlier. \\
%   			\citep{golchin1994} proposed a mechanism for organic matter input decomposition, suggesting that the formation and persistence of soil aggregate depends on the continuous input of organic matter into the soil. In line with this mechanism, the works of \citep{li2007} and \citep{redmile-gordon2020} provided evidence from field experiments showing a decrease in both SOC and aggregate stability during both long and short term periods of reduced or eliminated organic input.\\
%   			Results from the current work support this kind of evidence, showing  a marked decrease in AS in non-amended samples (Control) during a one month incubation ,compared with significant increases in AS when organic substrate (MRE) has been applied.
%   			Whatever significant differences in AS that might have been observed between ORG and MIN during the early period after LTTs were  effectively ceased (begining of the \textit{no input plus fallow period} ), it is \myRed{very} possible that these differences had been considerably diminished by the end of this two year period.\\
%
%	\subsubsection{Ergosterol}
%
%			the Erg-to-MBC ratio, was the only parameter for which UNC had a significantly higher baseline value compared with the two other LTTs (roughly 50\% higher than baseline Erg-to-MBC value in ORG or MIN).
%			ORG had a higher ratio than MIN, though this difference was not significant. The ERG-to-MBC reflects, with certain limitations, the ratio of fungal biomass to the total microbial biomass. Ergosterol does not represent arbuscular micorhyzal fungi (AMF), however, Since the experiments included in this work were performed without any living plants, it is reasonable to assume that the fraction of AMF and other plant symbiotic species, from the total funagl biomass is negligible.
%			It is generally agreed that changes in land use will have significant effects on microbial community composition\myRed{*}. agricultural intensification, especially but not exclusively increased tillage, can cause a reduction in overall fungal biomass and consequently a reduction in the fungi-to-bacteria ratio\myRed{*} although \gls{som}e results showed no significant differences\myRed{*}.
%			the current result, showing a significant reduction in ERG-to-MBC as a consequence of long-term cultivation practices, compared to a non-cultivated soil, is therefore mostly supported by prior evidences.
%			studies have shown contrasting results regarding the effect of long-term organic or mineral fertilization on the ERG-to-MBC ratio. \citet{heinze2010} found an increase in ERG-to-MBC in long-term chemically, compared with organically, fertilized soils, yet the mineral treatment was accompanied by a high straw return while the organic treatment was not, indicating that these differences might not have been  singularly affected by synthetic nitrogen application. A recent work by \citet{knoblauch2017} also found significantly higher values of ERG-to-MBC in long-term chemically fertilized grasslands, compared to soil subjected to organic amendments in the form of cattle slurry. However, cattle slurry has been shown to increase bacterial over fungal biomass \citet{knoblauch2017}.
%	 		\citet{probst2008} found a significant increase in ERG-to-MBC in organically managed vineyard soils receiving occasional compost doses, compared with conventionally managed soils receiving customary amounts of NPK. This extensive work included four pairs of organically and conventionally managed vineyards yet it is hard to determine the specific effect of the contrasting fertilization schemes since these were not separated from other variables such as tillage, certainly an important factor with potential influence. A more recent work by \citet{mackie2015} , also performed with vineyard soils, evaluated the effect of a one time compost application on ergosterol and found a significant increase after 6 months compared with a non-amended control soil. It is not entirely clear whether a similar effect was found for the ERG-to-MBC ratio since these results were not reported explicitly and it is was not possible to establish them from the provided data.
%			Given the unresolved nature of these evidences, it is not surprising that no significant difference in the ERG-to-MBC ratio was observed between ORG and MIN in this current work. However a clear distinction was observed between the two cultivated soils and UNC suggesting that factors other than fertilization, such as tillage, irrigation and plant productivity might have had a more substantial effect on the proportion of fungal biomass to the total microbial biomass.
